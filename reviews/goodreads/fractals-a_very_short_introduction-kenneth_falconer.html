<i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> is a very short book about fractal geometry.  It was written by Kenneth Falconer and published in 2009.

It is very small in size, runs just 132 pages including the index, and has 44 illustrations.  Despite its small size, it took me a few days to read it.  As someone just starting to learn about fractals &mdash; and wanting to experiment with drawing them myself &mdash; I found it to be the perfect primer for someone with a degree in math yet hasn't thought about exponents and logarithms in awhile.

I am giving <i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is an excellent introduction to the topic.  Its focus in on explaining the basics of fractal geometry, which relies on some advanced mathematics, but it does not have more math than it needs to have.  And for the benefit of those who, like me, could use a gentle reminder of some of the basics of topics like complex numbers, the author includes an Appendix with precisely just enough information to revive those dormant brain cells.

Fractal geometry is a very complicated topic, yet <i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> does an excellent job of starting from the beginning, using the very simple von Koch curve in Chapter 1, <i><u>The fractal concept.</u></i>  Chapter 2, <i><u>Self-similarity,</u></i> dives into one of the most important of these concepts, introducing the mesmerizing Sierpinski triangle and moving on to the self-similarity found in products of nature such as snowflakes and plants.

Chapter 3, <i><u>Fractal dimension,</u></i> is where things get complicated.  However Mr. Falconer clearly knows how to explain this non-intuitive idea in a way that makes it as intuitive as possible.  Having read this I think that, despite being new to all this, if I really tried, I could &mdash; with a bit of effort and a willing listener &mdash; actually explain this to someone.  At worst, if I failed, I could return to this chapter, figure out what I got wrong, and how I could do better next time.

Chapter 4, <i><u>Julia sets and the Mandlebrot set,</u></i> is where things get really deep.  The author remains true to form, however, explaining how mathemeticians make these forms &mdash; which are far more complicated than the von Koch curves &mdash; in a step-by-step manner.

<i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> is the third book I have read about fractal geometry.  I found it in the Denver Public Library, but when I got to Illustration 31, <i><u>Julia sets corresponding to various points of the Mandelbrot set,</u></i> I decided to buy my own copy.  It was just under $10, and in my opinion, especially in light of this incredibly simple yet profound illustration, worth every penny.

Chapter 5, <i><u>Random walks and Brownian motion,</u></i> is much less complicated than its two predecessors and introduces a fractal topic that is surprisingly highly relevant to many things we see everyday.  The essence of a random or "drunkards" walk is each step is randomly either forward or backward.  Kenneth explains how this can be seen as a model for things such as how molecules, prices, and even the stock markets move.

Chapter 6, <i><u>Fractals in the real world,</u></i> includes brief descriptions of fractal geometry's relevance to such diverse things as coastlines and landscapes, fractals in our bodies, clouds, galaxies, and even cell phone antenna design.  Finally Chapter 7, <i><u>A little history,</u></i> wraps up the book with a few pages about the key players in this research through the past few centuries.

I highly recommend <i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> to anyone wanting a solid, substantive introduction to fractal geometry.  Even though the book is small in size, every page is packed with information.

As someone who is anxious to try creating some of these 
Note however that although it is an excellent introduction, people wanting to take a deeper dive into the topic will want to find different &mdash; or additional &mdash; books.
