<i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> is a short book about fractal geometry.  It was written by Kenneth Falconer and published in 2009.

It is very small in size, runs just 132 pages including the index, and has 44 illustrations.  Despite its small size, it took me a few days to read it, albeit piecemeal and in my spare time.

As someone just starting to learn about fractals &mdash; and wanting to experiment with drawing them myself &mdash; I found it to be the perfect primer.  I earned a degree in mathematics from Virginia Commonwealth University in the 1980s, but haven't thought about exponents and logarithms in quite awhile.

I am giving <i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is an excellent introduction to the topic.  Its focus is on explaining the basics of fractal geometry, which relies on some advanced mathematics, but it does not have more math than it needs to have.  And for the benefit of those who could use a gentle reminder of some of the basics of topics like logarithms and complex numbers, the author includes an Appendix with precisely just enough information to revive those dormant brain cells.

Fractal geometry is a very complicated topic, yet <i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> does an excellent job of starting from the beginning and sticking to the basics.

In Chapter 1, <i><u>The fractal concept,</u></i> Falconer uses the very simple von Koch curve to introduce some of the core ideas underlying fractal geometry.  And in Chapter 2, <i><u>Self-similarity,</u></i> he dives into one of the most important of these concepts, by introducing the mesmerizing Sierpinski triangle and showing readers some of the self-similarity found in nature, such as that found in snowflakes and plants.

Chapter 3, <i><u>Fractal dimension,</u></i> is where things start to get complicated.  Mr. Falconer, however, clearly knows how to explain the not-very-intuitive idea of fractional dimensions in a way that makes it as intuitive as possible.  Having read this I think that I, despite still being a bit new to all this, could &mdash; with a bit of effort and a willing listener &mdash; actually explain this to someone.  At worst, if I failed, I could return to this chapter, figure out what I got wrong, and learn how I could do better next time.

Chapter 4, <i><u>Julia sets and the Mandlebrot set,</u></i> is as deep as Chapter 3, if not deeper.  The author remains true to form, however, explaining in a step-by-step manner how mathemeticians found and construct these forms &mdash; which are far more complicated than the von Koch curves.

<i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> is now the third book I have read about fractal geometry.  I found it in the Denver Public Library, but when I got to Illustration 31 in Chapter 4, <i><u>Julia sets corresponding to various points of the Mandelbrot set,</u></i> I decided to buy my own copy.  It was just under $10, and in my opinion &mdash; especially in light of this incredibly simple yet profound illustration &mdash; will be worth every penny as a reference.

Chapter 5, <i><u>Random walks and Brownian motion,</u></i> is much less complicated than its two predecessors and introduces a fractal topic that is surprisingly quite relevant to many things we see everyday.  The essence of a random or "drunkard's" walk is that each step is randomly either forward or backward.  Kenneth explains how this can be seen as a place to begin mathematically modeling things such as how molecules, prices, and even the stock markets move, which often seems to be in a rather random fashion.

Chapter 6, <i><u>Fractals in the real world,</u></i> includes brief descriptions of fractal geometry's relevance to things ranging from coastlines and landscapes, to the fractal patterns in our bodies, to clouds and galaxies, and all the way to cell phone antenna design.  Finally Chapter 7, <i><u>A little history,</u></i> wraps up the book with a few pages about the key players in this research during the past few centuries.

I highly recommend <i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> to anyone wanting a solid, substantive introduction to fractal geometry.  Even though the book is small in size, it is extremely well-organized and concise, and every one of its small pages is packed with information.

As someone who is anxious to try creating some of these designs I feel <i><u>Fractals, A Very Short Introduction</u></i> has given me the background I need to read some of the more advanced and comprehensive books on the subject.  Hopefully it has not made me overconfident, because I have also ordered copies of Falconer's <i><u>Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications</i></u> and <i><u>Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension</i></u> by Benoit Mandelbrot!
