<i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Graphic Guide</u></i> is a very short book about fractal geometry.  It was written by Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon, Will Rood and Ralph Edney, and published in 2009.

It is very small in size, runs just 176 pages including the index, and has a lot of pictures.  It took me just over a day to read it.  As someone just starting to learn about fractals, I found it to be very interesting because it gives a minimal yet still comprehensive historical overview of how geometry has evolved over the past two thousand years or so.

I am giving <i><u>Introducing Fractals</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because it is an excellent introduction to the topic.  However, towards the end it turns very "salesman-y," making a lot of claims about how wonderful fractals are without providing anything to back up these claims.  This of course is fine for an introduction to a topic, but for me to give it 5 stars it would need to make fewer claims and dive at least a little deeper to give some data or studies that justify the claims that remain.

Fractal geometry is a very complicated topic, yet <i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Graphic Guide,</u></i> does an excellent job of simplifying it for the average reader.  The book has virtually no math in it, preferring to use images &mdash; mostly drawings &mdash; to present the topic.

Even though the book is small in size, every page &mdash; except a few at the very end, such as the index &mdash; has at least one picture.  And many of the pages have more than just one image.

I recommend <i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Graphic Guide,</u></i> to anyone looking for a quick overview of fractal geometry.  Note however that although it is an excellent introduction, people wanting to take a deeper dive into the topic will want to find different &mdash; or additional &mdash; books.
