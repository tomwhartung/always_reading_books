<i><u>Because Internet, Understanding the New Rules of Language</u></i> is a book written by Gretchen McCulloch and published in 2019.

The author is a linguist who has spent her life studying how the English language has changed through the ages.  In Chapter 1, <i><u>Informal Writing,<u></i> she writes <i>"You never truly step into the same English twice"</i> [p.15].

I am giving <i><u>Because Internet</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because I found it to be very informative.  Most importantly, reading the book has taught me the difference between formal and informal writing, granting me the freedom to loosen up when exchanging messages with friends &mdash; assuming I dare to do so!

I for one like to obey all the rules, and feel like my late grandmothers will judge me harshly if I do not proofread <i>everything.</i>  Plus, of course, once you send it, it's too late to fix it, and it will be wrong forever!

Ms. McCulloch sees change as inevitable.  In Chapter 2, <i><u>Language and Society,<u></i> she writes <i>"every generation has talked slightly differently from its parents: otherwise, we'd all still be talking like Shakespeare"</i> [p. 30].  She also claims linguists estimate <i>"that women lead 90 percent of linguistic change"</i> [p. 34], and that the internet <i>"makes language change faster"</i> [p. 39].  These things are good to know!

One of the things I like most about the book is her discussion of sarcasm.  Gretchen writes that conveying irony in written material was a <i>"problem long before the internet"</i> [ p. 133].  She mentions how Henry Denham and John Wilkins proposed new punctuation symbols intended to communicate sarcasm centuries ago, in 1575 and 1668 respectively.

Although these ideas failed to take hold, it hasn't stopped people from coming up with innovative ways to express irony and sarcasm online and in text messages.

<blockquote><i>If polite typography, as we saw earlier, is about making extra effort, using initial capitals and friendly exclamation marks to signal cheerful distance or genuine enthusiasm, then ironic [e.g., raNdoMly mIxeD caSe] typography is the opposite on both counts: it introduces a note of dissonance that makes the reader look harder to find the double meaning.  Any variation from an expected baseline will do, whether that's lowercasing, sparkle sarcasm [e.g., "~~~~*****~~~~sparkle sarcasm~~~~****~~~~"], asking a rhetorical question by omitting the question mark, or ironically using outdated slang [such as "gr8"]....</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Because Internet</u></i>, by Gretchen McCulloch, p. 149.</blockquote>

Another interesting observation Ms. McCulloch makes regards emoticons and emoji, to which she dedicates all of Chapter 5, <i><u>Emoji and Other Internet Gestures.</u></i>  Some people might think these constitute a language unto themselves, but she refutes this notion.  Instead she asserts they are more like the gestures we make when speaking.  <i>"Just like gestures and facial expressions fit seamlessly with spoken words, punctuation-based emoticons can directly accompany typed words"</i> [p. 178].
