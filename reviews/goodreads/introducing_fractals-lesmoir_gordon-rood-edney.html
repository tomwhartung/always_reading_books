<i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Graphic Guide,</u></i> by Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon, Will Rood, and Ralph Edney
is a very short book about fractal geometry published in 2009.

It is very small in size, runs just 176 pages including the index, has a lot of pictures, and took me just over a day to read it.
As someone just starting to learn about fractals, I found it to be very interesting because it gives a minimal yet still
comprehensive historical overview of how geometry has evolved over the past two thousand years or so.

I am giving <i><u>Introducing Fractals</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because it is an excellent introduction to the topic.
However, towards the end it turns very salesman-y, making a lot of claims about how wonderful fractals are without
backing up these claims.
This of course is fine for an introduction to a topic, but for me to give it 5 stars it would need to make fewer
claims and dive at least a little deeper to justify the ones it makes.

Fractal geometry can be a very complicated topic, yet <i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Graphic Guide,</u></i> does
an excellent job in simplifying it for the average reader.

The book has virtually no math in it, preferring to use images &mdash; mostly drawings &mdash; to present the topic.
Even though the book is small in size, very page, except those such as the index at the very end, has at least one picture,
and many of them have more than one image.

I recommend <i><u>Introducing Fractals, A Graphic Guide,</u></i> to anyone looking for a quick overview of
fractal geometry.
It is great as an introduction, but if you want to take a deeper dive into the topic, you will want to find a different book.
