<i><u>Personality in Adulthood, A Five-Factor Theory Perspective</u></i> is a book by Robert R McCrae and Paul T Costa Jr. published in 2006.
Costa and McCrae developed the NEO-PI-R personality assessment, which makes them like the Myers-Briggs of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality.

I am giving <i><u>Personality in Adulthood</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is full of win.
It focuses on demonstrating how a person's basic tendencies &mdash; as measured by the NEO-PI-R or a similar inventory &mdash; remains fairly stable after age 30, and while doing so it covers a wide range of topics relating to the theory of personality
