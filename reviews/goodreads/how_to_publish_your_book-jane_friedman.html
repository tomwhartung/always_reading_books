<i><u>How to Publish Your Book/u></i> is a Course Guidebook by Jane Friedman published in 2015.
Throughout the course she offers details about the ins-and-outs of publishing both fiction and nonfiction.

The book was published by The Great Courses, and as such comes with a set of video lectures.
The course is available online, but I was able to take the course for free by checking out the book and dvds from the public library here in Denver, Colorado.

I am giving <i><u>How to Publish Your Book/u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is very well-organized and comprehensive, covering all aspects of publishing.
Also, it is obvious Jane Friedman is highly knowledgeable, and in addition to being well-informed, her presentation is very matter-of-fact and objective.

The author initially focuses on publishing for the Big Five Trade Companies, which is no doubt what most people think of when they think of writing or buying a book.
But she also covers the benefits and caveats of self-publishing, discussing Amazon to a great extent, in several of the 24 total 1/2 hour lectures.

The course is dated 2015 but she mentions that the Big Five publishing companies are slow moving, and I am confident much of her presentation is still relevant.
In addition to thoroughly covering the Big Five and self-publishing models, she mentions there are also smaller, independent presses available for people who are willing to dig into the marketplace -- and she goes into great detail about how to do this sort of digging.

The most interesting part of the course for me is her discussion of an <i>author's platform.</i>  Prior to this course I had an intuitive notion of what a platform is.  Now, thanks to this course, I can see how it is most important for me, as someone who has no pre-existing market for my Spiritual Portraits.
Ms. Friedman describes how <i>"it will grow differently for every author,"</i> then explains in detail exactly how <i>"in general, platform has six components,"</i> [p. 54] and describes how authors can benefit from having a website, being active on social media, seeking out events, etc.

The idea of an <i>author's platform</i> is especially applicable to self-publishing authors, but it pertains those who seek to work with the Big Five as well.
Jane Friedman knows the reality of how much work promoting a new book entails, and explains how an author's platform can be a huge help in this respect.

I recommend <i><u>How to Publish Your Book/u></i> to any writer &mdash; and in particular those who are unpublished &mdash; who is wants to be a successful author.

At worst, depending on your publishing goals, you may have to wade through some irrelevant information, depending on whether you're wanting to publish a Best Seller or work with a "Vanity Press."
There are actually lots of options between those two extremes, and she covers it all.

Certainly, if you are experiencing some frustration in getting attention for your work, this course is for you.
For example, Lecture 16 is entitled <i><u>How Writers Handle Rejection,</i></u> and Lecture 17 is entitled <i><u>Overcoming Obstacles to Writing.</i></u>

Thus the book's comprehensiveness is not really a drawback, because working your way through this course might show you options you did not know you have.

If you have always wanted to write and publish a book, taking this class is an excellent first step!
