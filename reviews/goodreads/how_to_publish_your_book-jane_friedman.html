<i><u>How to Publish Your Book/u></i> is a Course Guidebook by Jane Friedman published in 2015.

The book is published The Great Courses, and as such comes with a set of video lectures.
The course is available online, but I was able to take the course for free by checking out the book and dvds from my local library here in Denver, Colorado.

I am giving <i><u>How to Publish Your Book/u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is very well-organized and comprehensive, covering all aspects of publishing.
It's obvious Jane Friedman is highly knowledgeable and I feel her presentation is very matter-of-fact and objective.

She covers the ins-and-outs of publishing both fiction and nonfiction, and initially focuses on publishing for the Big Five Trade Companies, which is no doubt what most people think of when they think of writing or buying a book.
But she also covers the benefits and caveats of self-publishing, discussing Amazon to a great extent, in several of the 24 total 1/2 hour lectures.

The course is dated 2015 but she talks about how the Big Five publishing companies are slow moving, and I am confident much of her presentation is still relevant.
In addition to thoroughly covering the Big Five and self-publishing models, she mentions there are also smaller, independent presses available for people who are willing to dig into the marketplace -- and she goes into great detail about how to do this sort of digging.

I recommend <i><u>How to Publish Your Book/u></i> to any writer &mdash; and in particular those who are unpublished &mdash; who is wants to be a successful author.
At worst, depending on your publishing goals, you may have to wade through some irrelevant information, depending on whether you're wanting to publish a Best Seller or work with a "Vanity Press."
There are actually lots of options between those two extremes, and she covers it all.
Thus its comprehensiveness is not really a drawback, because taking this course might show you options you did not know you have.

Certainly, if you are experiencing some frustration in getting attention for your work, this course is for you.
For example, Lecture 16 is entitled <i><u>How Writers Handle Rejection,</i></u> and Lecture 17 is entitled <i><u>Overcoming Obstacles to Writing.</i></u>

7,500 listings of markets that pay writers, including book publishers, magazines, literary journals, and

and *Guide to Literary Agents.*  The listings are vetted and updated regularly.

As you take stock of your platform as a nonfiction author, evaluate your strengths in the following areas:
- Publishing or distributing quality work in media outlets with which you want to be identified and that
your target audience reads.
- Producing a body of work on your own turf that gathers followers, such as a website and blog, e-mail
newsletter, podcast, or video series.
- Being active and visible on social media.
- Speaking at events that your target audience or community attends.
- Partnering with peers or influencers to produce creative projects or extend your visibility.
 - p. 54.

Because platform building is an organic process, it will grow differently for every author, but in general,
platform has six components:
- Your writing or content that's publicly available, including all of your traditionally published work, self-
published work, and online writing.
- Your social media presence, including the mainstream sites (Twitter, Facebook), as well as online communities
and message boards where you're active.
- Your website; this is usually critical for any ongoing platform activity because it acts as the hub for all
your efforts.
- Your relationships, including the people you know personally, as well as devoted readers.
[page break]
- Your influence, that is, your ability to get people you don't know to help you out or pay attention to you.
- Your reach -- the number of people you can reliably broadcast a message at any given time.
In platform building, it's important to remember that you are communicating directly with readers.  Be consistent
with your voice and style; don't adopt a "marketing voice" that's different from your real voice.  Also, focus on
what's satisfying and engaging.  Publish, post, and share things that fascinate or puzzle you, or ask questions
for others to answer.
The people you reach, either online or off, will be at different stages of commitment to you and your work.  For
this reason, your communication should be segmented by audience as much as possible.  In particular, two types of
readers deserve special attention: people who are new to your work and true fans who would buy anything you published.
For the first group, offer something for free, such as the first book in a series or a special digital download.  For
the second, consider providing exclusive communications and experiences, such as early access to new work.
 - pp. 57-58.

[Book] Proposals vary in length, content, approach, and presentation.  Each book requires a unique argument for its
existence -- or, a specific business case -- and, thus, requires a unique proposal.  However, all book proposals must
answer three strategic marketing questions: So what?  Who cares?  Who are you?
- The answer to the first question is essentially the reason for your book's existence -- the unique selling proposition
that sets your book apart from others on the market.
- The answer to the second question describes your target readership and the size of your audience.
- The answer to the third question addresses your authority or credentials to write the book and the existence of an
appropriate platform that makes you visible to the target audience.
In preparing a book proposal, keep in mind that editors who work at commercial publishers care about to things: a viable
idea with a clear market, paired with a writer who has credibility and marketing savvy.  Knowing your audience or market
and having direct and specific ways to reach it gives you a much better chance of success.  Pitch only the book you know
has a firm spot in the marketplace.  Don't pitch a book with the expectation that the publisher will bring the audience
to you.

Also, you don't need to put the copyright symbol anywhere on your work for it to be protected under the law.  But if you
self-publish your work or otherwise distribute it publicly, then you should officially register it with the U. S. Copyright
office.

As mentioned earlier, Writer Beware is an important online hub for writers who have concerns about any publisher, service,
or organization in the writing community.  *The Independent Publishing Magazine* by Mick Rooney is a website that regularly
reviews and discusses new self-publishing and digital services for writers.  It's one of the rare resources that is
comprehensive and objective about this sector of the industry.

Finally, consider the following timeless factors when your [sic] revisiting your writing career and making decisions about
your next steps forward:
- What makes you happy?  Happiness is the reason you got into writing in the first place.  Even if you put it on the back
burner to advance other aspects of your writing career, don't leave it out of the equation for long.  Otherwise, your efforts
can come off as mechanistic or uninspired, and you'll eventually burn out.
- What earns you money?  Not everyone cares about earning money from writing, and writers who are looking to become rich
should probably find another field.  But as you gain experience, the choices you make in this regard become more important.
The more professional you become, the more you [page break] must pay attention to what brings the most return on your investment
of time and energy.
- What reaches readers or grows your audience?  Sometimes, you'll want to make trade-offs that involve earning less money to
grow readership because doing so is an investment in the future.  For example, some industry conferences don't pay speakers, but
they put you in front of important insiders or influencers in your community.
In the end, if you believe that you can't stop writing even if someone tells you that it's a waste of time or won't get you a
deal, then you're much closer to publication than another writer who is easily discouraged.

A Writer's Dilemmas
First, are you creating primarily for yourself or primarily for an audience?
- . . .
- . . .
- . . .
Second, how much of yourself will you share with readers?
- Having a readership necessitates some kind of persona or brand....  When you're able to express your reasons for writing, you're
on your way to developing an identity or brand for yourself as an author.
- As humans, we tend to be most strongly attracted to people who are producing work from a deep place, rather than from a
superficial drive to make money or become famous.  Look at some of the most remarkable author brands, and you'll often find people
who exhibit a strong core belief system throughout their work.
 - p. 117.

It's important to note that independent bookstores also play a role in turning a book into a bestseller.  The American Booksellers
Association, a professional organization for independent booksellers, holds regular conventions that are also attended by publishers;
some publishers bring along some of their authors who they believe have the potential to break out if supported by the independent
bookseller community.
- The power of *hand-selling* -- when bookstore staffs make personal recommendations to their customers -- can also play a pivotal
role in a new author's success.  Such recommendations may be more likely to happen if the booksellers meet the author at an industry
convention or otherwise get more personal insight into an upcoming title.
- For these and other reasons, some authors go out of their way to support independent bookstores as part of a book launch or overall
marketing campaign.  Some will even adopt an independent bookstore to be their fulfillment center for anyone who wants to find a signed
copy.  Such relationships help both the bookstore and the book generate more buzz.

Author Websites
An essential task for any author today is to establish a website that serves as a hub and information clearinghouse for everything he or
she publishes.  A website serves as your primary calling card in the digital age.  Whatever type of marketing strategy you pursue, it
will be more effective with a website in place.
There's some truth to the belief that a bad website or an out-of-date website can be more damagingthan no site at all, but most authors
are quite capable of constructing and maintaining sites after being educated properly.  Further, no site has to be perfect at launch.
Authors can start small and build their skills and presence over time.  It may even be worthwhile for an unpublished writer to start a
website.
- Starting a site when you're unpublished helps you get over the learning curve....
- Also, having a site helps slowly extend brand awareness, especially if you're active on social media or elsewhere online.  This tends
to be particularly important for nonfiction authors [page break] who are building their authority and reach in order to persuade a
publisher to offer a contract.
- Finally, having a site opens up opportunities....
 - pp. 142-143.

*** Important!!! ***
If you're an unpublished author, your site needs only one or two pages.  Include a short bio, mention any credits or media appearances,
link to your social media accounts, and briefly describe the type of writing work you do.  Don't belabor your unpublished status.
- Your professional bio should run about 100 or 200 words.  You may also include a professional head shot if you have one or another good photo.
- You might include a tagline or description in your site header that clearly describes your brand....
- Next, you should have a page dedicated to your published or forthcoming books.  You might have a separate page for each book or product, or
you might combine them.  Regardless, don't skimp on the details, and always include links to where your books can be purchased in both print and
digital form.
- Always let readers know where else you're active online....
- You should also mention notable media coverage, good reviews, testimonials, or a significant following you have on another platform.  Such
positive attention constitutes *social [page break] proof,* that is, it sends out strong signals that other people have found your writing
worthwhile.
 - pp. 143-144.

Facebook is not an adequate replacement for an author website for a number of reasons....

If you're comfortable with very little to no service, you can use the major services that distribute POD specifically for self-published
authors, such as Amazon's CreatSpace and IngramSpark.  With these services, which are virtually free, you can often see your book for sale
at major online retailers in as little as 48 hours.
This entire process becomes simpler if you plan to self-publish and distribute your book only in e-book format.  E-book services typically
fall into two categories.
- First, there are retailer-specific distribution and sales services that are 100 percent free to use, such as Amazon's Kindle Direct
Publishing.  As an author, you work directly through a self-service interface to make your work available for sale almost [page break]
instantly.  It's as simple as opening an account, uploading your book files, and pushing the "Publish" button.
- Also available are e-book distribution services, such as Smashwords.  They offer a centralized site to upload your work, which they then push
out to all the major online e-book retailers.  Some e-book distributors charge an upfront fee, while others take a percentage of your sales.
- Understand that these services are not publishers.  They are distributors and retailers  They take no responsibility for the quality of your
work, but neither do they take any rights to your work.  You use these services on an at-will basis.  If you decide you've made a mistake in
publishing your e-book, you can remove it from availability as quickly as you uploaded it.
 - pp. 152-153.

When using an e-book retailer or service, keep the following pointers in mind:
- First, check to see if the retailer or service is exclusive or nonexclusive.  Most work on a nonexclusive basis, which means that you can
sell your e-book at many different retailers at once.
- Second, you should always be in control of the price.  Although some retailers may have reasonable pricing restrictions, such as not allowing
you to price below $0.99, the standard practice is to give the author control over pricing.  However, most e-book retailers mandate that you not
offer more favorable pricing elsewhere.
- Third, you should always understand how much money you'll earn on each book sale.  For example, Amazon Kindle offers you 70 percent of your
book's list price as long as you price between $2.99 and $9.99.  If you price outside that range, you'll earn 35 percent.
- Fourth, make sure you understand how much freedom you have to make changes to your e-book after it goes on sale.  Retailers [page break]
generally allow you to upload revised files as often as you like, but distributors may require you to pay a fee to make changes.
- Finally, check what formats are required from you.  Most retailers allow you to upload a Word document, which is automatically converted into
whatever format is needed.  Most services offer guidelines and preview programs to ensure that your e-book looks good before it goes live.
 - pp. 153-154.

- With giveaways, independent authors may run into trouble if they have only one or two books to sell and nothing else to offer readers or if
they don't establish any means to contact readers in the future, whether via e-mail newsletter or social media.  The other catch is that the
quality of your work must match the expectations of your audience.  If it doesn't no amount of giveaways will help you.
- Whether you use KDP Select or not, giveaways can be an effective part of a larger marketing strategy.  But before you use them, make aure you
understand your reader funnel and the demand curve for your work.
 - p. 159.

Garnering Reviews
In addition to leading to visibility and new readers, giveaways can also result in more reviews for your work, and getting a good number of
reviews early on can tip the scales in your favor.  Although no one knows what the Amazon algorithm favors, most authors see that once they have
around 60 or 70 reviews, the visibility of their books on Amazon is improved.  It's also well-known that readers make buying decisions based on
the content of the reviews.

[Garnering Reviews - cont'd.]
One method of encouraging reviews is to enroll in the KDP Select program.  Another option is to do a giveaway on Goodreads, a social medial site
for books and reading with more than 35 million members.  Goodreads is favored by both traditional publishers and self-publishers for getting the
word out an generating pre-publiction buzz.  The drawback is that Goodreads gives away physical books only, which requires a small investment from
the author and won't work at all for authors who are publishing only in e-book format.
A more e-book friendly solution is to use an e-mail marketing service that targets readers looking for cheap or free reads, such as BookBub.  Any
author can submit work to BookBub to be considered for inclusion in e-mail promotions to readers, as long as the book can be downloaded from a
major and is offered for free or at a major discount.  If your book is accepted for promotion, you'll be charged a fee based on a variety of
criteria.  This type of promotion can lead to a wave of new reviews on Amazon or Goodreads.
Finally, the old-fashioned way of getting book reviews is to go door-to-door and ask for them.  Several major online directories, including
the Book Blogger Directory and The IndieView, list book reviewers and book bloggers that you can pitch for review coverage.  You can also try
contacting reviewers in Amazon's Vine program, which is a group of people hand-selected by Amazon as among the best reviewers on the site.

Releasing New Work
Both publishers and successful authors know that writing and releasing a new work is one of the best and most reliable marketing tools for
boosting sales of previous and future books.  This phenomenon can be so pronounced that successful authors have counseled beginners to all
but stop marketing efforts and, instead, focus on producing new work.
 - p. 160.

*** Important!!! ***
This is probably the most boring advice possible, but the truth is seldom glamorous.  Few authors want to hear that the way to build their
career is to work hard for a long time.  Although you may want to find readers for the book you already have instead of writing a new one,
the painful reality is that if you're a self-publishing author who only ever writes one book, your chances of succeeding with it in a
meaningful way are very low.
Authors who are advanced in their self-publishing strategies tend to develop long-term series, with each release building on the characters
and tension in the previous books and creating an irresistable hook for readers.  We can see an interesting parallel in the binge-watching
that's now common with TV series available on demand.  Authors tap into the same kind of addictive potential by building out a story arc over
a number of books.
Having more books out there also aids in generating more word of mouth.  You'll have more readers telling their friends that they absolutely
must read your books.  But the first step is to write books that are worth sharing.  Reading is a significant investment of time, and accepting
a book recommendation is, therefore, an act of trust.  Most people will suggest only those books that give readers an excellent experience, not
just an interesting story.

The Future of Nonfiction
For the foreseeable future, we will experience a revolution in how we find, use, and share information.  On the most practical level, authors
who understand when and how a book is needed or valuable for their audience will have a leg up on the competition.
In particular, for nonfiction authors, the book simply cannont be the end of what you offer.  Agents and editors want to see that a book is
just one aspect of your much larger purpose and strategy for serving an audience.
Publishers who specialize in reference already understand that some books are too expensive to produce for how fast they go out of date and
how easily the same information online.  Thus some nonfiction publishers have stopped talking about books and now focus on *content strategy,*
recognizing the need to deliver information in adaptable forms through different channels, formats, and environments.
Going even further, the CEO of one large educational publisher has said that his company's job is not to deliver information or content but
to develop services.  By that, he means servicing universities, students, and professionals with online courses, assessment, workflow tools,
communities, and of course, digital books.
