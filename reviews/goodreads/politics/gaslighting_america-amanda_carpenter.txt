<i><u>Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us</u></i> is a book by Amanda Carpenter published in 2018.
I have read several other books about the Trump Administration, including <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52095121-michael-wolff-collection-2-books-set' class='book-title' title='Link to my review of the books Fire and Fury, and Seige, on goodreads.com' target='_blank'><i><u>two books by Michael Wolff,</u></i></a> and found this book to be much more enlightening.

Amanda Carpenter wrote her book for readers who want to learn more about the breadth and depth Donald Trump's lies.
She describes in detail the former president's process for creating alternate realities and convincing his supporters that his versions are real.

I am giving <i><u>Gaslighting America</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because, unlike other books about DJT which are more fact-based, the author reveals patterns in the former president's divisive rhetoric.
She describes how Trump's particular brand of<i>"Gaslighting is far more aggressive than"</i> just lies, and <i>"that there is a very specific method to his madness"</i> [p. 15].

Near the end of her book, Amanda acknowledges that <i>"gaslighting is a type of manipulation that takes place in one-on-one romatic relationships"</i> [p. 185].
Her book, however, is all about the unique process that Donald Trump uses.
In Chapter One she lists the specific steps that <i>"are almost always present in his political attacks"</i> [p. 15], revealing his process is much more complicated.

The steps Amanda lists in Chapter One are <i>"Stake a Claim....  Advance and Deny....  Create Suspense....  Discredit the Opponent....  [and] Win"</i> [p. 15].
After citing numerous examples throughout the book, she repeats this list in the first Appendix, for easy reference.
Her examples include the story of how Donald gaslighted her and Ted Cruz, who was her boss at the time, in 2016.

People who have seen one or both of the Gaslight movies &mdash; the
<a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031359/' title='Link to the page for the British Gaslight movie (1940) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>British version from 1940</a> or the
<a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036855/' title='Link to the page for the American Gaslight movie (1944) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>American version from 1944</a> &mdash;
will notice that DJT has enhanced the basic technique.
This is because, of course, he is gaslighting not just one person, but an entire country, or at least the entire GOP.
