<i><u>Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us</u></i> [2018] is an excellent book by Amanda Carpenter.
I have read several other books about the Trump Administration, including <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52095121-michael-wolff-collection-2-books-set' class='book-title' title='Link to my review of the books Fire and Fury, and Seige, on goodreads.com' target='_blank'><i><u>two by Michael Wolff,</u></i></a> and found this book to be much more enlightening.

Amanda Carpenter wrote her book for readers who want to learn more about the breadth and depth Donald Trump's mendacity.
In it she describes in detail the former president's process for creating alternate realities and convincing his supporters that the things he says are true, when at best most of his claims are <i>"truthful hyperbole"</i> [p. 207].

I am giving <i><u>Gaslighting America</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because, unlike other books about DJT which are more fact-based, Amanda reveals patterns in the former president's divisive rhetoric.
She describes how Trump's particular brand of <i>"Gaslighting is far more aggressive than"</i> just lies, and <i>"that there is a very specific method to his madness"</i> [p. 15].

The author does not acknowledge that <i>"gaslighting is a type of manipulation that takes place in one-on-one romatic relationships"</i> [p. 185] until the book's <i><u>Afterword.</u></i>
Instead, she elucidates and focuses on the somewhat more sophisticated process that Donald Trump uses from the very beginning.

At the end of Chapter One, <i><u>Birthing a President,</u></i> she lists the specific steps that <i>"are almost always present in his political attacks"</i> [p. 15].
These steps are are <i>"Stake a Claim....  Advance and Deny....  Create Suspense....  Discredit the Opponent....  [and] Win"</i> [p. 15].

After citing many examples of Donald's use of this process throughout the book, she uses slightly different terms to repeat this list in the <i><u>Appendix I,</u></i> for easy reference.
Her examples include the story of how Donald gaslighted her and Ted Cruz, who was her boss at the time, in 2016.

People who have seen one or both of the Gaslight movies &mdash; the <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031359/' title='Link to the page for the British Gaslight movie (1940) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>British version from 1940</a> or the <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036855/' title='Link to the page for the American Gaslight movie (1944) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>American version from 1944</a> &mdash; will notice that DJT has enhanced the basic technique of simply questioning a lover's perceptions.
This is because, of course, he is gaslighting not just one person, but an entire country &mdash; or at a minimum the entire Republican Party.
