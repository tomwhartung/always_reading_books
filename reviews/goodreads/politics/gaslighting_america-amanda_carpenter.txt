<i><u>Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us</u></i> [2018] is an excellent book by Amanda Carpenter.  I have read several other books about the Trump Administration &mdash; including <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52095121-michael-wolff-collection-2-books-set' class='book-title' title='Link to my review of the books Fire and Fury, and Seige, on goodreads.com' target='_blank'><i><u>two by Michael Wolff</u></i></a> &mdash; and found this book to be much more enlightening than any of those.

Amanda Carpenter wrote her book for readers who want to learn more about the breadth and depth Donald Trump's <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/' title='List compiled by the Washington Post of over 30,000 false or misleading claims made by Donald Trump while he was president' target='_blank'>mendacity</a>.  In it she describes in detail the former president's process for convincing his supporters that everything the mainstream media reports is <i>"fake news,"</i> while maintaining everything he says is true &mdash; when at best the majority of his claims are what Trump's <i><u>Art of the Deal</u></i> ghostwriter called <i>"truthful hyperbole"</i> [p. 207].

I am giving <i><u>Gaslighting America</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because &mdash; unlike other books about DJT which are more fact-based &mdash; Amanda reveals the <i><u>patterns</u></i> in the former president's divisive rhetoric.

In Chapter One, <i><u>Birthing a President,</u></i> Carpenter describes how Trump's particular brand of <i>"Gaslighting is far more aggressive than"</i> just lies, and details the <i>"very specific method to his madness"</i> [p. 15].

The author does not acknowledge that <i>"gaslighting is a type of manipulation that takes place in one-on-one romatic relationships"</i> [p. 185] until the book's <i><u>Afterword.</u></i>  Instead, from the very beginning she elucidates and focuses on the somewhat more sophisticated gaslighting process that Donald Trump uses.

At the end of Chapter One, Amanda lists the specific steps that <i>"are almost always present in his political attacks"</i> [p. 15].  These steps are <i>"[1] Stake a Claim....  [2] Advance and Deny....  [3] Create Suspense....  [4] Discredit the Opponent....  [and 5] Win"</i> [p. 15, step numbers added for clarity].

The book contains many examples of how Donald used this process before and during his campaign for president.  The examples include the tale of how Donald spread the birther lies about Barack Obama, stories of how Trump also gaslit each of the mainstream Republican candidates for president in 2016, and a first-hand account of how he gaslighted her and Ted Cruz &mdash; who was her boss at the time.

Anyone who has seen one or both of the <i><u>Gaslight</u></i> movies &mdash; the <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031359/' title='Link to the page for the British Gaslight movie (1940) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>British version from 1940</a> or the <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036855/' title='Link to the page for the American Gaslight movie (1944) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>American version from 1944</a> &mdash; will notice that DJT has enhanced the basic gaslighting technique of simply questioning a lover's perceptions.  This is because, of course, he is pulling the wool over the eyes of not just one person, but an entire nation &mdash; or at a minimum the entire Republican Party.

In Donald's enhanced gaslighting process, the second step, <i>"Advance and Deny,"</i> is the trickiest for us normal, honest people to grasp.  As it turns out, one of the former president's favorite techniques is to confuse people by contradicting himself!

An example makes this much easier to understand:
<blockquote><i>If you didn't know that advancing and denying a narrative at the same time was one of Trump's staple techniques, you would think that a statement he made on March 14 to be strange [sic].  "The press is now calling, they're saying, 'Oh, but there's such violence.'  There's no violence," Trump said before hedging a bit.  "You know how many people have been hurt at our rallies?  I think like, basically none, other than I guess maybe somebody got hit once or something.  But there's no violence."  Yes, someone maybe got hit, but no violence, no!</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>Gaslighting America</u></i>, by Amanda Carpenter, 2018, p. 112.</blockquote>
Amanda explains this blatant duplicity in Chapter 10, <i><u>Kayfabe,</u></i> by quoting sociologist Nick Rogers, who describes how Donald's supporters resemble fans of professional wrestling.  Nick asserts that <i>"To a wrestling audience, the fake and the real coexist peacefully."</i> [p. 130].

As anyone who has confronted a Trump supporter with facts knows, the truth doesn't matter &mdash; facts are just <i>"fake news."</i> Rogers explains this by stating <i>"Kayfabe isn't merely a suspension of disbelief, it is philosophy about truth itself.  It rests on the assumption that <u>feelings are inherently more trustworthy than facts</u>"</i> [p. 131, emphasis added].

The book's <i><u>Afterword</u></i> includes suggestions for <i>"Fireproofing."</i> My favorite section in this part of the book is Amanda's recommendations for dealing with conspiracy theorists.<blockquote><i>One question can determine whether you are dealing with either a conspiracy theorist or someone who may be able to explain some questionable phenomena: "What evidence would prove this isn't true?"  If the answer is nothing, back away slowly.  You're dealing with a full-blown conspiracy theorist!  There's no use in the conversation aside from the entertainment value.  If you take it seriously, you'll only spin around in dizzying logic circles until you fall flat on your face.</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>Gaslighting America</u></i>, by Amanda Carpenter, 2018, p. 191.</blockquote>
The <i><u>Afterword</u></i> concludes with some suggestions for ways <i>"political candidates can fireproof themselves in this new gaslit America"</i> [p. 192].  Carpenter goes so far as to suggest that people running for office <i>"Start gaslighting a little.  No, I do not mean making up deranged stories to smear your opponents.  What I mean is, take control of the narrative.  That's what Trump does best."</i> [p. 200].

The book concludes with three Appendices.  In <i><u>Appendix I</u></i> she recaps Donald's customized gaslighting process.  <i><u>Appendix II</u></i> contains a series of quotes that demonstrate how Trump uses <i>"hyperbole to play up his accomplishments and attack critics, often invoking the words 'never before' and 'in history' to dramatize his acts."</i> At best these are just his opinions, and <i>"most are demonstrably false."</i> [p. 207].

Finally, in <i><u>Appendix III,</u></i> she offers a list of some quotes from Donald's <i>"official spokespersons and media friends."</i> She finds their efforts <i>"to prove their loyalty to the president"</i> make it <i>"difficult to take [them] seriously,"</i> and her recommendation is to just <i>"Roll your eyes .... [And] have a good chuckle"</i> [p. 213].

I recommend <i><u>Gaslighting America</u></i> to all Americans who are concerned about our country's future.

Although Donald's term has ended, it is clear that he still exerts influence over the majority of the Republicans who remain in office.
And that's not all: at this time many of those office-holders see Trump as someone worth imitating.
