Notes and quotes from Ageing, A Very Short Introduction, by Nancy A. Pachana, 2016.

Chapter 1, A brief history
Medicine in ancient times was characterized by a belief that imbalance in the organism,
particular of the four 'humours' (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm), resulted
in illness.  Although many thinkers at that time, including Aristotle and Galen, believed
that a creeping 'dryness' in the body upset the balance of humours an could lead to illness
and decay, it was also balance in the exercise of physical as well as sensory desires.
- p. 6.

For example, in many societies, *gerocomy,* the belief that intercourse with younger women
could delay or even reverse ageing, was common.  And unfortunately, this belief persists in
sub-Saharan Africa, where sex with younger women in pursuit of health benefits has contributed
to the spread of HIV and AIDS.
- p. 13.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Much less optimistic is the 16th-century German description of the decades of life:
- 10 years -- a child
- 20 years -- youth
- 30 years -- a man
- 40 years -- standing still
- 50 years -- settled and prosperous
- 60 years -- departing
- 70 years -- protect your soul
- 80 years -- the world's fool
- 90 years -- the scorn of children
- 100 years -- God have mercy
- p. 16.

In modern gerontology there is a distinction made between the 'young-old' (aged 65-74), 'old-old'
(aged 75-84), and 'oldest-old' (aged 85+).  There is renewed interest in studying this latter group,
particularly as globally, longevity increases on average by about three months per year, or about
five hours per day.
