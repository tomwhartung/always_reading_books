Notes and quotes from Ageing, A Very Short Introduction, by Nancy A. Pachana, 2016.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 1 - A brief history
Medicine in ancient times was characterized by a belief that imbalance in the organism,
particular of the four 'humours' (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm), resulted
in illness.  Although many thinkers at that time, including Aristotle and Galen, believed
that a creeping 'dryness' in the body upset the balance of humours an could lead to illness
and decay, it was also balance in the exercise of physical as well as sensory desires.
- p. 6.

For example, in many societies, *gerocomy,* the belief that intercourse with younger women
could delay or even reverse ageing, was common.  And unfortunately, this belief persists in
sub-Saharan Africa, where sex with younger women in pursuit of health benefits has contributed
to the spread of HIV and AIDS.
- p. 13.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Much less optimistic is the 16th-century German description of the decades of life:
- 10 years -- a child
- 20 years -- youth
- 30 years -- a man
- 40 years -- standing still
- 50 years -- settled and prosperous
- 60 years -- departing
- 70 years -- protect your soul
- 80 years -- the world's fool
- 90 years -- the scorn of children
- 100 years -- God have mercy
- p. 16.

In modern gerontology there is a distinction made between the 'young-old' (aged 65-74), 'old-old'
(aged 75-84), and 'oldest-old' (aged 85+).  There is renewed interest in studying this latter group,
particularly as globally, longevity increases on average by about three months per year, or about
five hours per day.
- p. 16.

Chapter 2 - Physical and biological aspects of ageing
Changes in the organism on a biological, psychological, and social level, evolving primarily as a
result of the passage of chronological time, are the definition of *primary ageing.*  Primary ageing
changes include wear and tear on organs as a result of their use over time, and we can do very little
to slow or reverse such changes.  Examples of changes in human biology as a function of primary ageing
include decreased productionf of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the brain, as well as a
decreased sensitivity of neural receptors in the brain to receive such messages (see Table 2 for more
such examples of primary and secondary ageing effects).  Note that the magnitude of declines in such
primarly ageing changes are relatively stable across the lifespan, but their cumulative effect may
become more noticeable as we age.
*Secondary ageing* is, by contrast, the term for changes in the organism that are a result of a
disease process, as well as damage [page break] to the organism due to life events, such as experience
of head trauma; and the results of lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise.  Examples of secondary
ageing effects include the development of cardiac disease or Alzheimer's disease.  Whereas changes due
to primary ageing are more universal and largely unavoidable, those due to secondary ageing do not affect
all persons, and are often amenable to interventions and in many cases also to prevention.  There are
some grey areas in between primary and secondary ageing: for example, when does wear and tear on joints
and cartilage (primary ageing) become arthritis (secondary ageing)?  Unfortunately, with increased age
our ability to bounce back from illness or other forms of physical or emotional strain declines.  Thus
preventative strategies in later life are important, and have as their goal maintaining health and
functional capacity for longer before declines occur.
- pp. 23-24  [Emphasis in original as italics.].

A key element of this theory is the idea of *scaffolding.*  The older individual compensates for
decrements in cognitive functioning by recruiting, in essence, additional brain power from more
intact portions of the brain, ones less affected by the ageing process.  For example, older adults
routinely use both sides of their brain to complete tasks for which younger adults use only one
hemisphere.  This harnessing of additional cognitive functioning coupled with experience contributes
to the finding that older adults often show superior performance on problems requiring complex,
relativistic thinking, particularly those demanding recognition of diverse perspectives or the synthesis
of contradictory information.  STAC-r shows the brain to be a dynamic organ that can adapt to changes in
its functioning as a result of the ageing process.
- p. 33.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Dementia does not affect all adults or even a majority of older adults.  For persons over age 65, in
most developed and developing countries, approximately 6-8 per cent of individuals will have some form of
dementia.  For individuals over 80, approximately [page break] 20-25 per cent will have some form of
dementia.  Women are at greater risk of developing dementia, and this is particularly true in very advanced
old age, but how much of this is due to women's longer lifespan is a matter of debate in the literature.
However, in all cases, dementia is not a part of normal or primary ageing but represents a neurological
disease (secondary ageing) characterized by distinct changes in the brain.
- pp. 33-34.

If changes persist over time or are quite acute (suggesting some acute causative event such as a stroke),
the consultation with a health professional is warranted.  If changes in thinking, emotions, or behaviours
begin to impact daily life and particularly familiar tasks, such as way-finding (i.e. getting lost in
familiar places), then seeking professional advice is probably warranted.
