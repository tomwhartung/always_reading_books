Quotes from Viruses - A Very Short Introduction, by Dorothy H. Crawford, 2011, 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole structure is called a *virion* and the outer coat is caled the *capsid.*  Capsids come in various
shapes and sizes, each characteristic of the virus family to which it belongs.  They are built up of protein
subunits called *capsomeres* and it is the arrangement of these ar ound the central genetic material that
determins the shape of the virion.  For example, pox viruses are brick-shaped, herpes viruses are icosahedral
(twenty-sided spheres), the rabies virus is bullet-shaped, and the tobacco mosaic virus is long and thin like
a rod (Figure 1).  Some viruses have an outer layer surrounding the capsid called an *envelope.*
Most viruses are too small to be seen under a light microscope.  In general, they are around 100 to 500 times
smaller than bacteria, varying in size from 20 to 300 nanometres in diameter (nm; 1 nm is a thousand millionth
of a metre) (Figure 2.)
