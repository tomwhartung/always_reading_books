Notes and quotes from Open Versus Closed, Personality, Identity, and the Politics of Redistribution,
by Christopher D. Johnston, Howard G. Lavine, and Christopher M. Federico, 2017.

Jost and colleagues (2003) argue that two "core" aspects of political conservatism, opposition to change and acceptance of inequality,
are driven by chronic or situationally induced needs to reduce insecurity and uncertanty in one's social environment.  From this
perspective, conservatism embodies support for the status quot -- for long-standing values, institutions, and socioeconomic heirarchies.
By its very nature, then, conservatism represents support for the known over the unknown, for the "tried and true" over the insecurity and
uncertainty intrinsic to social change.

In their work, Jost and his colleagues (2003, 2009) find that many psychological variables tapping the closed personality type are associated
with conservative political orientations.  For example, to cite one of the oldest variables in this literature, *authoritarianism* emerges as
a clear predictor of political conservatism.  Authoritarianism is typically defined as a general attitude of deference to authority and
convention, coupled with punitiveness and animosity toward "deviant" outgroups, and a skeptical view of democracy.  Contemporary views
consider authoritarian attitudes and behavior to be rooted in chronic differences in sensitivity to threat and uncertainty aversion. [page

and dangerous.  Indeed, threat sensitivity among authoritarians is even detectable at an unconscious level.  For example....  Authoritarianism
has also been consistently linked to variables tapping an aversion to uncertainty and ambiguity.  More recently, Hetherington and Weiler (2009)
have provided evidence that the authoritarian predisposition is closely tied to conservative policy preferences.  Specifically, they show that
citizens who value obedience and order over individuality and self-reliance lean to the right on a range of policy issues, from gay marriage to
the war on terrorism.
