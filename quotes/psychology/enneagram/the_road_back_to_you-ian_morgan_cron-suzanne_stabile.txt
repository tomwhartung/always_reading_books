Quotes from The Road Back to You, An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery by Ian Morgan Cron and Suzanne Stabile, 2016.

Note: I read only the first two chapters of this book.

Chapter 1: A Curious Theory of Unknown Origin, pp. 9-20
[None]

Chapter 2: Finding Your Type, pp. 21-38
Learning to manage your deadly sin rather than allowing it to manage you is one of the goals of the Enneagram.
There are other personality typing systems or inventories like the Myers-Briggs or the Five Factor test that are wonderful but
exclusively psychological in oriantation.  There are others that describe and encourage you to embrace who you are, which isn't very
helpful if who you are is a jerk.  Regardless, only one of these instruments addresses the fact that we are spiritually mottled
creatures.  The Enneagram is not exclusively psychological, nor is it feel-good, self-help pablum when taught correctly.  (By the
way, if my "self" could have helped my "self," don't you think my "self" would have done it by now?)  The true purpose of the
Enneagram is to reveal to you your shadow side and offer spiritual counsel on how to open it to the transformative light of grace.
Coming face-to-face with your deadly sin can be hard, even painful, because it raises to conscious awareness the nastier bits about
who we are that we'd rather not think about.  "No one should work with the Enneagram if what they seek is flattery.  But no one
should fail to do so if what they seek is deep knowing of self," as David Benner cautions.  So, bravely on!
