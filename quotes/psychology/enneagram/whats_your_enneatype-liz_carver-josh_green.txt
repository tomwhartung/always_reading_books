ABOUT THE COLORS

Finally, a note on the colors.  We use one unique color for each type, and these colors were not chosen at
random.  Here is some more information on each color and why we chose it.

The colors for ONEs are black and white.  ONEs see the world in black and white -- there is now ambiguity in how
they see anything.  ONEs are known to have a clear sense of right and wrong.  Black and white are clean, precise
colors, similar to how ONEs see the world in a logical, orderly way.  Black is a solid, strong, and consistent
color.  You can never go wrong wearing a black suit or a black dress.  This is similar to how healthy ONEs embody
consistency and decisiveness in a way that most other types do not.

The color for TWOs is blue.  In nature, blue is most commonly associated with the sky and the sea, which represents
TWOs in several ways.  Calm waters and clear blue skies demonstrate calmness, peace, and stability, which are
qualities that TWOs can embody.  The sky and sea can also bring about fierce storms, which is appropriate because
TWOs can love like a "mighty ocean," as the artist Sleeping at Last describes in the song "Two," moving mountains
to give the love needed to the people in their lives.  However, like a force of nature, TWOs can also disrupt
everyone else's apparent peace and calmness if they feel unappreciated or taken advantage of for too long, bringing
out a more chaotic storm.

The color for THREEs is orange.  THREEs are known to be engaging and winsome, so the vibrancy of orange captures
the way that many people are drawn to THREEs.  Orange is also associated with health and vitality (think fruits and
vitamin C), which speaks to the productivity and efficiency of THREEs.  Finally, while THREEs are known to have
strong, confident personalities, they are also known to constantly adapt to their environment so that they can be
seen as successful, however that may look in any given situation.  Thus, THREEs are represented by a secondary color
that, while bright and strong, is not a primary color all by itself.
