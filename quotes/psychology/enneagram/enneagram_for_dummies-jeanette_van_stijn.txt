This short list spells out where the attention of the individual types is focused, what they're fixated on, and which part of
reality they mainly perceive:

Type 1: What is right, what is wrong, what can be improved, what is someone (or what am I) doing correctly or incorrectly?

Type 2: Who or what needs my help, where and how can I serve others, how do I attract appreciation and confirmation, do people
think I'm nice, or what is needed?

Type 3: What do I need to achieve, who or what needs my input, and how can I ensure that I draw applause and am seen as the best?

Type 4: What is missing in my life and in my relationships, what am I separated from, and what do others have that I don't have
(and vice versa)?

Type 5: What does someone want or expect from me, who or what is invading my privacy and taking up my time and energy, and can I
(or do I even want to) offer something to others?

Type 6: What can go wrong, where is there any danger, where are the risks and what do they look like, whom or what can I trust,
and what is the secret plan?

Type 7: Which options and possibilities are out there, what is pleasant and what isn't, who or what is limiting me, and how do I
keep my freedom and my space?

Type 8: What is true and what isn't, who or what is unfair, what needs my protection, and how do I attract respect, power,
strength, and control?

Type 9: Who or what is threatening the harmony, how can I avoid discord or restore harmony, what does the other person want,
and what can I do so that you continue to be happy and nice?
