Notes and quotes from Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change
by Olga Khazan, 2025.

## Chapter 3, Dance Like Everyone Is Watching: **Extroversion,** pp. 43-70

Trying on extroversion allows you to understand others, I found, and also to understand yourself.  Because sharing our thoughts
clarifies them, Emerson wrote, "Sinsere and happy conversation doubles our powers."  Like a *superhero,* when I cloaked myself
in extroversion, I felt my powers heightening, readying me for a leap into the unknown.

## Chapter 5, Down for Whatever: **Openness to Experience,** pp. 99-122

Open people are keenly sensitive to the marvelous and the awe-inspiring.  One sign you might be open is if, when you see or
hear something especially magnificent, the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and shivers go down your spine.
- p. 100.

## Chapter 7, Get 'er Done: **Conscientiousness,** pp. 157-182

But a technique called *episodic future thinking* can help correct this cognitive error [succumbing to short-term transient
"rewards" rather than working toward the more substantial rewards of acheiving long-term goals].  The researchers Cristina
Atance and Daniela O'Neill describe episodic future thinking as our ability to project ourselves into the future, essentially
"pre-experiencing" something, much like we might recall a prior vacation or argument.  But instead of remembering the past,
the practice entails vividly imagining a future scenario, down to the explicit details -- like what you'll be wearing for the
work presentation, who will be in the room, and from which deli you'll order a sandwich afterward.  This act turns our
attention to those far-off rewards, and to what we could be doing now to make them more likely.
- p. 164.  Emphasis in *italics* added.

## Chapter 8, Enduring vs. Ending: **On Knowing When to Quit,** pp. 183-204

In fact, [psychologist Brian] Little and some others say the key to a healthy personality may not be in swinging permanaently
to the other side of the personality scale but in balancing between extremes, or in adjusting your personality from one
situation to another.  *"The thing that makes a personality trait maladaptive is not being high or low on something, it's
more like rigidity across situations."* Kathryn Paige Harden, the behavioral geneticist, told me.

## Chapter 9, Find Your Beach: **How to Keep Changing,** pp. 205-220

Long term personality change is more likely to be successful if it's in the service of a "personal project," or a meaningful
quest in your life.  This can be raising your kids, or helping stop climate change, or in my case, being a good journalist
and partner.  What keeps Tim [Curran, who quit drinking, lost weight, and ultimately turned his life around during the
COVID-19 pandemic] going is that with each thing he's doing, whether it's eating healthily or intereacting socially, "it
feels like I'm building toward something bigger," he says.
- p. 209.
---------

Neuroticism will continue to visit me, even if its presence lightens.  But personality change isn't all or nothing: Just
like personality traits themselves, it's a spectrum.  You have to appreciate floating through its gradients.
- p. 216.
