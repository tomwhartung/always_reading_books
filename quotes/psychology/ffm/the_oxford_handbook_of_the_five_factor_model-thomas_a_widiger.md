I pulled several quotes from a paper in this book to answer this question on quora.com:

- "What are some non-English words with no equivalent?"

## My Answer

From what I can tell, there are not many words of this type — at least as far as descriptors of personality are concerned.

The *Oxford Handbook of the Five Factor Model* includes a paper entitled *Universal and Specific in the Five Factor Model of Personality* by Juri Allik and Anu Realo.  This paper looks at “the potential universality of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of general personality structure.”  [p. 173]  (You can find information about the FFM on the Wikipedia (http://wikipedia.org) website.)

The authors write that most languages have so much in common that “it is more appropriate to talk about *near-universals*”  [p. 174] than universals.  One example that is the opposite of what you are asking about, but interesting nonetheless, is the fact that “there are equivalents for the word anger in all major languages of the world.  Yet there is one society — the Urkuhikhalingmiut (“Utku”) Eskimos — that does not have a special word for anger.”  [p. 175]

More relevant to your request are a few terms the authors describe on page 178.  They introduce these terms by stating “It has been argued that imposing a factor structure derived from Western Samples [i.e., the FFM] on non-Western cultures may leave unnoticed unique personality factors specific to these cultures alone, called *emic* dimensions of personality.”

Following are a few of these terms, all of which appear on page 178.

* “Because *ren qing* — friendly person — is believed to be deeply rooted in the Chinese mentality, European concepts are not sufficient to describe this specific aspect of Chinese culture.”
* “Friendliness, politeness, and sympathy are highly valued in the Spanish culture in which there is even a special word for it — *simpatico*.”
* “It is also believed that Portuguese *suadade* — a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that is loved — has no appropriate translation into English or any other language.”
* “Although it may not be easy to translate the German *Schadenfreude* into English, nobody really doubts that feeling gloating pleasure, Dutch comfort, or mischief-joy is totally alien to Anglo-American culture.”
* “Russians in the nineteenth century began to define themselves in terms of their spiritual qualities, their distinctive ‘Russian soul’ or *dusha*.”

I should note that the paper cites references for each of these terms, which you can find in the book.

In case someone interested in the FFM reads this someday, I feel compelled to conclude with a final few quotes that summarize the authors’ point with respect to these terms.  “As it turned out, most of the variance in the emic items could be explained by the known Big Five factors [Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism].”  In other words, although “There is no question that cultures may have their unique traits such as *ren qing* or *simpatico* . . . .  It was observed, for example, that the mean differences between cultures or geographic regions are typically 10 times smaller than the average interindividual variance within those cultures or regions.  [p. 178]
