- Essential Astrology: Learn to Be Your Own Astrologer and Unlock the Secrets of the Signs and Planets

by Joanna Watters, 2023.

## Introduction, pp. 5-7
The road to astrology is paved with misconceptions, which are largely down to the fact that the gap
between Sun-sign astrology and horoscopy is immense....  [Media horoscopes such as] Your stars in a
newspaper, magazine, or on a website are not in fact your "horoscope," but an astrologer's "take" on
the current planetary activity.  Even when written professionally, such columns can only generalize,
they still wear the fortune teller's hat and are inevitably branded in the public eye as entertainment.
- p. 6.
---------

Simply by typing "calculating your horoscope," any search engine will direct you immediately to numerous
astrology sites that offer this [calculating a birth chart] service.
- p. 6.
---------

Two websites that I have found reliable in chart calculation are
http://www.alwaysastrology.com/birth-char-calculator.html and
http://astrologyabout.com/library/bl_freeAstrochart.htm.

If you do not know your time of birth, then simply enter 12:00 midday.  This will produce what is known
as a Noon Chart.

The following illustrations of the twelve signs of the zodiac are therefore designed to encapsulate
their core meaning.

interpretation and goes way beyond an understanding of just the Sun sign.

[Elements and Modes -> Elements -> Characteristics]

Fire: warmth, passion, vision, intuition

Earth: sensuality, practicality, fertility, materialism

Air: thought, intellect, ideas, interaction

Water: feelings, sensitivity, empathy, instinct

Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung had a lifelong interest in astrology.  The four cognitive
functions of the psyche, which he conceived originally, correlate directly with the four elements.  The
links between the psyche and the elements can be delineated as follows:

Fire - Intuition - Intuitives find meaning through what may be termed non-rational information, such as
hunches or visions.  They can make leaps of imagination or connect their insights in a way that leads to
"I just know" answers.

Earth - Sensation - Sensates find meaning through rational information as gathered through the five
senses of sight, taste, touch, sound, and smell.  Their world is one of concrete reality in which a sixth
sense is either absent or disregarded.

Air - Thinking - Thinkers find meaning through rational information, such as facts and figures.  They
operate by what makes sense; they look for logical connections and are disorientated by people or matters
that they cannot understand.

Water - Feeling - Feelers find meaning through non-rational information and operate purely on the basis
of how someone or something makes them feel.  They react emotionally and base their judgements on
pleasant or unpleasant impressions.
- p. 49.
---------

[Elements and Modes -> Modes]

Cardinal - This mode represents the element in its most concetrated or active form.  It is associated
with push, energy, and initiation.

Fixed - As the name suggests, this mode represents the element in its least changeable form.  It is
associated with stability or stubbornness.

Mutable - Sometimes called "common," this mode represents the element at its most fluid.  It is
associated with flexibility, movement, and the dissemination of energy.
- p. 51.

## Chapter 2: The Planets, pp. 52-y

[Mars -> Mars in Leo]

The Mars-drive coupled with the Leo-knack for drawing a crowd recates a showmanship quality, charismatic
performers, and "the show must go on" work ethic -- just think of "The Boss" Bruce Springsteen (b.
September 23, 1949)....  In business, this is the archetype of the managing director; the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO), and the entrepreneur, such as Donald Trump (b. June 14, 1946).
- p. 84.
---------

[Saturn -> Saturn in Capricorn - Dignity or 10th House]

Saturn in its own sign of Capricorn is purposeful but always calculating.  These Saturn people generally
have an ambitious streak a mile wide but also know the pitfalls of making a fast buck.  There is an empire
builder in all strong Saturnian types, but this Saturn, in particular, is surprisngly versatile and can
turn his and to anything, whether it is children's entertainment (Walt Disney, December 5, 1901-December
15, 1966), the music industry (Simon Cowell, b. October 7, 1959), international media (Rupert Murdoch,
b. March 11, 1931) or running a country (Barack Obama, b. August 4, 1961).  The flip side of the coin is
rigidity and those who never bend the rules.
- p. 97.
---------

[Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto -> Uranus - Co-ruler: Aquarius]
Uranus was discovered in 1781, coinciding with the French and American revolutions and the industrial
revolution in England.  He is therefor the planet of rebellion, anarchy, social advancement, ecology,
and technology.  Both Bill Gates and the late Steve Jobs have strong Uranus-Aquarius features in their
horoscopes.
- p. 98.
---------


## Chapter 3: The Houses and Ascendants, pp. 102-123

[In a Nutshell]
In terms of astrological symmetry, the houses work in pairs of opposites

1st House - the Self
7th House - Significant Other

2nd House - Personal finances, the resources for life
8th House - Shared finances; death and goods of the dead

3rd House - Communication, local environment, and early education for survival
9th House - Higher education and wider horizons, for experience and understanding

4th House - Home, family, and private life
10th House - Purpose and public life

5th House - Personal pleasures and creativity, children
11th House - Group pleasures and concerns, friends

6th House - Physical health, service
12th House - Spiritual life, sacrifice
- p. 107.
---------

[The Ascendant -> Leo Ascendant or the Sun in the First House]
With a Leo Ascendant, regardless of the Sun sign, the ruling planet of the horoscope is the Sun.  This
planet's sign and house will be a primary consideration in the process of interpretation.
- p. 114.
---------

[The Ascendant -> Scorpio Ascendant or Mars or Pluto in the First House -> Manner and Speech]
Can come across as reserved, private, formitable, or fascinating.  They have phenomenal reserves of
determination and their approach to life and relationships in particular is intense, emotional, and
profound.  Individuals with this rising sign, and **especially a 1st house Pluto,** need to forge deep
connections and tend to give short shrift to those deemed to be flippant or superficial.  New faces and
situations are put through remoresless screening and they attach great importance to their first
impressions.  Usually these are uncannily correct.
- p. 116.  **Emphasis added.**
------------------------------

[House Rulership -> Chart Ruler]
As already stated, the ruling planet of any horoscipe is the planet that rules the sign on the Ascendant.  So, if Virgo is rising, the native will be ruled by Mercury; if Libra is rising, they will be ruled by Venus, and so on..  When considering the three signs that have a co-ruler (Scorpio, Aquarius, and Pisces), always take the traditional plant as the primary significator and the co-ruler as the secondary.  For example, if Pisces is rising, the native will be ruled by Jupiter and secondly by Neptune, the co-ruler.

One of the first vital steps in interpretation is to locate and assess the "condition" of the chart ruler; that is, to determine how strong or weak the planet may be interms of sign, house, and then aspects (relationship) to other planets (aspects will be explained in Chapter Four).
