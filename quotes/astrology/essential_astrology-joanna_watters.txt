Notes and quotes from:

- Essential Astrology: Learn to Be Your Own Astrologer and Unlock the Secrets of the Signs and Planets

by Joanna Watters, 2023.

## Introduction, pp. 5-7
The road to astrology is paved with misconceptions, which are largely down to the fact that the gap
between Sun-sign astrology and horoscopy is immense....  [Media horoscopes such as] Your stars in a
newspaper, magazine, or on a website are not in fact your "horoscope," but an astrologer's "take" on
the current planetary activity.  Even when written professionally, such columns can only generalize,
they still wear the fortune teller's hat and are inevitably branded in the public eye as entertainment.
- p. 6.
---------

Simply by typing "calculating your horoscope," any searc engine will direct you immediately to numerous
astrology sites that offer this [calculating a birth chart] service.
- p. 6.
---------

Two websites that I have found reliable in chart calculation are
http://www.alwaysastrology.com/birth-char-calculator.html and
http://astrologyabout.com/library/bl_freeAstrochart.htm.

If you do not know your time of birth, then simply enter 12:00 midday.  This will produce what is known
as a Noon Chart.

interpretation and goes way beyond an understanding of just the Sun sign.

[Elements and Modes -> Elements -> Characteristics]

Fire: warmth, passion, vision, intuition

Earth: sensuality, practicality, fertility, materialism

Air: thought, intellect, ideas, interaction

Water: feelings, sensitivity, empathy, instinct

Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung had a lifelong interest in astrology.  The four cognitive
functions of the psyche, which he conceived originally, correlate directly with the four elements.  The
links between the psyche and the elements can be delineated as follows:

Fire - Intuition - Intuitives find meaning through what may be termed non-rational information, such as
hunches or visions.  They can make leaps of imagination or connect their insights in a way that leads to
"I just know" answers.

Earth - Sensation - Sensates find meaning through rational information as gathered through the five
senses of sight, taste, touch, sound, and smell.  Their world is one of concrete reality in which a sixth
sense is either absent or disregarded.

Air - Thinking - Thinkers find meaning through rational information, such as facts and figures.  They
operate by what makes sense; they look for logical connections and are disorientated by people or matters
that they cannot understand.

Water - Feeling - Feelers find meaning through non-rational information and operate purely on the basis
of how someone or something makes them feel.  They react emotionally and base their judgements on
pleasant or unpleasant impressions.
- p. 49.

[Elements and Modes -> Modes]

Cardinal - This mode represents the element in its most concetrated or active form.  It is associated
with push, energy, and initiation.

Fixed - As the name suggests, this mode represents the element in its least changeable form.  It is
associated with stability or stubbornness.

Mutable - Sometimes called "common," this mode represents the element at its most fluid.  It is
associated with flexibility, movement, and the dissemination of energy.
