Notes and quotes from:

 Essential Astrology: Learn to Be Your Own Astrologer and Unlock the Secrets of the Signs and Planets

by Joanna Watters, 2023.

## Introduction, pp. 5-
The road to astrology is paved with misconceptions, which are largely down to the fact that the gap
between Sun-sign astrology and horoscopy is immense....  [Media horoscopes such as] Your stars in a
newspaper, magazine, or on a website are not in fact your "horoscope," but an astrologer's "take" on
the current planetary activity.  Even when written professionally, such columns can only generalize,
they still wear the fortune teller's hat and are inevitably branded in the public eye as entertainment.

Simply by typing "calculating your horoscope," any searc engine will direct you immediately to numerous
astrology sites that offer this [calculating a birth chart] service.

Two websites that I have found reliable in chart calculation are

and [http://astrologyabout.com/library/bl_freeAstrochart.htm](http://astrologyabout.com/library/bl_freeAstrochart.htm).
