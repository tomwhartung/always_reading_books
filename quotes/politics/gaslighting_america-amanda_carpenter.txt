Notes and Quotes from Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us, 2018.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 1 - Birthing a President
His [Donald Trump's] intense commitment to his outlandish ideas is a form of virtue signaling to his base.  It says,
"I'll do anything to win and beat the people you don't like."
- p. 8.

Gaslighting is far more aggressive than any of these misguided lies.  It's an elaborate scheme undertaken to gain control over
people.  Trump is an expert gaslighter and what I want you to understand that there is a very specific method to his madness.
- p. 15.

[These] steps are almost always present in his political attacks...:
o Stake a Claim....
o Advance and Deny....
o Create Suspense....
o Discredit the Opponent....
o Win....
- p. 15.

Chapter 2 - Winning Ugly
[none]

Chapter 3 - #War
I remember him [Andrew Breitbart] relaying his now well-known mantra, "Politics is downstream from culture," and explaining the importance
of bringing our conservative perspective to the media.
- p. 23.

Gay marriage wasn't the only issue liberals demanded rapid acceptance of during the Obama years that generated lots of attention in right-
wing media.  In 2008 transgenderism was barely known, but by 2916 Democrats were call to provide government-mandated benefits for it.  The
idea that sex-change therapies and surgery should be freely available came into vogue, on demand for middle schoolers and members of the
United States military alike.  Conservatives, for the most part, questioned the wisdom of allowing minors to transform their God-given
bodies with drugs and surgery or taxpayer funding of such procedures for convicted soldiers like Chelsea Manning.  They wanted a safe place
to hash this out.  Conservative media provided that.
Then there is abortion, the gruesome matter that sends people running into opposing bunkers faster than anything else.  I hesitate to even
discuss it; it's so sickening, so upsetting, but that's all the more reason not to shy away.  Here we go.  A few years ago, a legitimate
house of horrors was discovered in West Philadelphia, run by Philadelphia abortionist Dr. Kermit Gosnell.
- p. 27.

Chapter 4 - Terrorized
[none]
Chapter 5 - Inside Job
[none]
Chapter 6 - Burned

Chapter 7 - The Pledge
Through it all, Trump is totally committed to his story, like a method actor.  That's because there can be no halfway measures of gaslighting;
it's an all-or-nothing proposition.  If he doesn't appear to fully believe what he's saying, he could never convince anyone else.  Thus, Trump
never, ever breaks character or gives his audience reason to doubt their confidence in him.  It all has the net effect of making him look and
sound strong.  Voila!  The things Trump fans love about him are the specific traits he best exhibits when he's gaslighting.
Therein lies the real secret to Trump's success.  It's not the "art of the deal," as he titled his bestselling memoir that made him famous.
It's in the *sell.*  And Trump's cunning ability to sell anything is what propelled him to gaslight America all the way to the White House.
All he does is keep applying the same method to different circumstances.  By the time you reach the end of this book, you'll be able to predict
Trump's -- that supposed political madman -- next move with ease.
