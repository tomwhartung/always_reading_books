## Chapter 2 - The Calm Before the Storm: How QAnon Started, pp. 15-32

[Tracy] Diaz wrote that they approached her to launch a forum on Reddit, and on November 17, 2017, they lauched the first subreddit
devoted to QAnon, called r/CBTS_stream, with "CBTS" standing for "calm before the storm."

## Chapter 4 - Boom Week Coming: The Scams and Conspiracy Theories That Begat QAnon, pp. 49-66

### From William of Norwich to Hunter S. Thompson

The Q movement has also worked hard to advance centuries-old traditions of blaming Jews for horrible crimes against innocent Christian
girls and boys.  This so-called blood libel -- named after an accusation in 1144 that a group of Jews ritually murdered and consumed
the blood of an English boy named William of Norwich -- has driven countless crimes against Jews, from organized pogroms in the Middle
Ages to social media harassment in the twenty-first century.  And a new version of it drives Q discourse now.

The modern blood libel takes the form of paranoia over "adrenochrome," a supposed superdrug extracted from the adrenal glands of
live children to confer eternal life to its consumers.  The term has never appeared in a Q drip, but adrenochrome is still referenced
constantly in the discourse of Q promoters, to the point where a number of major news outlets wrote about it in the struggle to
understand why so many people were getting sucked into Q.  Adrenochrome and Q fit together easily.

p. 53.

Both NESARA and the dinar were specifically mentioned as defrauding several of the Q believers profiled in a 2021 *Huffpost* story.
All the while, they stay addicted to what skeptics deem "hopium" -- the relentless and inexhaustible hope of a better future passed down
through secret knowledge.

Like the promises of QAnon, that future never arrives.  But unlike QAnon, the law could actually do something about these schemes.

p. 66.

## Chapter 5 - We Are the News Now: QAnon Has a Bit 2019, pp. 67-83

Over the next three months, Jim Watkins and his son, Ron, tried a number of different avenues to get their board back up and running,
rebranding it as "8kun" -- a name change meant to denote that the "chan," an honorific used in Japanese to express affection for babies,
children, and honored elders, had grown into a "kun," denoting an older and more respected person.  And after awhile the Watkinses
finally found a new web host -- a Vancouver, Washington, programmer named Nick Lim, who had founded the Internet service provider (ISP)
Bit Mitigate, which also hosted the neo-Nazi message board the Daily Stormer.  Lim did business by the motto "If it's legal, I don't care,"
and evidently, he didn't.  Because 8kun -- bringing with it all of the racism and anarchy of 8chan 00 was announced a few weeks later --
with security provided by Lim's company.

p. 80.

## Chapter 6 - God Wins: Why People Believe in QAnon, pp. 85-101

To any reasonable person, the failure of a long-foretold event erodes the belief that it will happen.  But belief isn't reasonable.  And
this stubborn lack of logic isn't limited to people who think the deep state is trying to murder their children.  We all have an innate
need to believe in good things that are extremely unlikely to take place.  It's the essence of hope.  Chicago Cubs fans spent an entire
century, one generation after another, insisting that maybe they'd win the World Series next year -- and every year they were let down.
Until the year they did win the World Series, that is.  Most Christians wait for the Second Coming of Christ, and century after century,
Christ does not come again.  This is not a sign of lunacy, it's the way belief works.  These things give people hope.  And a life without
hope is . . . hopeless.

Even when presented with crushing proof that they've been fooled, they still believe -- often taking the proof that they're wrong as proof
that they're actually right and are over the target.  To do otherwise would be to give in to hopelessness.

That's how it's gone with Q's precursors.  Even as local governments and law enforcement agencies putout notices warning people that the
dinar was a scam, and after numerous dinar brokers were indicted, dinar-guru message boards still pumped out "intel [page break] updates."
In 2018, the *Daily Beast* reported on Trump supporters who were making huge dinar purchases based on a cryptic comment from the president
that "all currencies would be on a level playing field" in his dealings with China.  During the COVID-19 lockdown, hundreds of thousands of
tweets mentioning NESARA were sent, while people claimed without evidence that their credit card debt and mortgages were suddenly vanishing,
and that the CARES Act -- passed by Congress in May to bolster the COVID-ravaged economy -- was actually the long-awaited release of
"prosperity packets."

pp. 85-86.  [Ellipsis in original.]

As Q would say many times, "Nothing can stop what is coming.  Nothing."

p. 86.

**Another New Hope**

To understand why QAnon followers believe in spite of everything requires understanding why people believe in conspiracy theories in the
first place.

Human brains need to recognize dangerous situations, and we are hardwired to seek patterns, to find order in chaos, and to exert control
where none can be found.  Conspiracy theories, at their most basic level, assert that we are in danger from hidden forces.  This helps
give difficult questions and random events satisfying answers -- and puts us at the center of those events.  A person doesn't get cancer
because of some randomly misfiring cells -- they got it because of chemtrails or 5G Internet or microchips poisoning them.  [page break]
Our beloved candidate didn't lose an election because they ran a poor campaign -- they lost because of the conspiracy of a corrupt cabal
to keep them from power.  And on and on.

Our lives are often full of failure -- personal, professional, and collective.  We don't want to believe these failures are due to honest
mistakes by others or random chance.  And most of all, we don't want to believe that they're our own fault.  To believe otherwise is to
believe that either we screwed up, or that we have no control over what happens to us.  And that's just too horrible to accept.

"Conspiracy theories resonate with some of our brain's built-in biases and shortcuts, and tap into some of our deepest desires, fears, and
assumptions about the world and the people in it," writes author and psychologist Rob Brotherton in the introduction to his ground-breaking
book *Suspicious Minds: Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories.  "We are all natural-born conspiracy theorists."

Such beliefs don't begin with the Internet, nor are they more prevalent in the Internet age.  Decades of polling consistently show that
over half of Americans believe in some conspiracy theory, and that about as many people in 1963 believed that multiple assassins killed
JFK as they did in 2013.

As long as something major and unexpected takes place, there will be people who witness it and struggle to explain it.  In his book,
Brotherton goes all the way back to the years after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE to find the legendary Roman historian Tacitus writing
up rumors that gangs of thugs kept citizens from fighting the fires, and that the corrupt emperor Nero had set the devastating fire for
his own aims.

pp. 86-87.

**Conspiracies That Came True**

The balance between appreciating danger in the world around us and the unswerving faith in a conspiracy theory comes to a head in the
false equivalence between unproven theories and misdeeds that have been retroactively discovered.  To conspiracy theorists the latter are
considered "conspiracy theories that came true," and proof that whatever conspiracy currently being argued is also true.  But there is a
crucial difference between conspiracy theories and conspiracies.

p. 89.

Conspiracies, of course, are real.  Nobody disputes that....  [T]here have been plenty of instances when someone's else's misdeeds *did*
give people cancer -- but those misdeeds didn't involve chemtrails or 5G Internet poisoning, because those aren't real things.  Toxic
dumping, hiding carcinogens in food, polluting water, and the like actually give people cancer, and are carried out by major companies
all the time.  These are real things.

p. 89.  [Emphasis in original.]

[The author mentions the conspiracy to kill Ceasar in Rome and the one to kill President Lincoln, his Vice President, and Secretary of War.]
A conspiracy of German officers tried to kill Adolf Hitler in July 1944.  And the US Public Health Service engaged in a grossly unethical
four-decade conspiracy to withhold syphilis treatment from Black sharecroppers in Tuskegee, Alabama.

All of these are conspiracies.  But they are not "conspiracy theories that came true" because none were theorized in any specific way.
Nobody knew about them, and many were only revealed thanks to whistleblowers, the revelation of legal documents, or the arrests of [page
break] the conspirators.  Likewise, none of the widely held conspiracy *theories* so popular in today's discourse, from the supposed
poisonous spraying of chemtrails in the air to 9/11 being an inside job carried out by the US government, have ever been "revealed" as the
truth.  Their sheer size and scope make them all but impossible.

p. 89-90.  [Emphasis in original.]

But people believe the conspiracy theories because they fit in with the biases they already have about how the world "really" works.  As
we've seen, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  But for many Q believers, that nebulous feeling that *They're all out to get me* becomes
*They're all out to get me, and I'm going to get them first.*  This is the danger of Q -- not that people believe it, but that believing it
means that those who don't are the enemy.  And as we've seen again and again, [page break] from Hoover Dam to the Capito, it's extremely
dangerous.

For the Q believer, then, Q is not a conspiracy theory -- and many believers bristle at the term, calling themselves "conspiracy researchers"
instead.  And it provides its believers something nobody usually expects out of cultish conspiracy movements -- hope.

pp. 90-91.  [Emphasis in original.]

## Chapter 7 - This Is Not a Game: The Many Crimes of QAnon Followers, pp. 106-121

**Good and Evil**

An unseen war between right and wrong is pretty much the crux of QAanon.  I reached out to Professor [Mark] Juergensmeyer [of the University
of California, Santa Barbara] to ask if I was overreacting by drawing a parallel between QAnon and Al Qaeda or ISIS -- and it turns out, I
wasn't.

While Juergensmeyer believes that most Q believers will eventually move on to something else, "the exceptions are the dangerous ones."
Echoing the example of [1993 World Trade Center bomber] Mahmud Abouhalima, he continued that "these are the true believers who are willing
to risk their lives to undertake an act, which we see as terrorism, [that's] consistent with their ideologies."

"The secrecy is part of the potency.  It gives the followers a sense of smug satisfaction that they know something that everyone else does
not know.  Terrorist attacks are meant as much to assure the [page break] followers that there is a war going on as it is to shock the
imagined enemy," he went on.  And then he said something that made my stomach drop: "When the United states was attacked on 9/11 much of the
imact was due to the surprise -- not knowing who did this and why.  It is not inconceivable that QAnon followers could commit acts of this
magnitude."

QAnon has become both organized and violent much more quickly than any form of Islamic extremism.  Al Qaeda had been around for well over a
decade when its hijackers took control of four airplanes in the skies over the East Coast and used them to commit the worst attack on the
continental United States in history....  But it's not just mass casualty events within Q's grasp -- smaller family tragedies happen all the
time thanks to Q and the people who have given their lives to it.

pp. 106-107.

This "no true Scotsman" fallacy, by which Q believers wrote off any violent action by their comrades as a false flag carried out to make Q
look bad, powered virtually all of the discourse in the movement about the rot inside it.  Nobody devoted to Q looked inward at what was
powering this violence -- only outward to who would want to hurt their movement.  So Q believers claimed the FBI report was forged by Yahoo!
in order to discredit Q, Timothy Charles Holmseth was a CIA plant with the job of fomenting violence in the Q movement, and Cynthia Abcug's
case was merely a custody dispute and here link to Q was "propaganda and lies from the cabal's agents."

"The media have no evidence that Q followers are violent," wrote prominent QAnon promoter David "Praying Medic" Hays in a 2020 blog post
that claimed the FBI bulletin was fake.  "Such evidence doesn't exist."

While Q believers find it easy to write off any violent episodes they encounter in the media as the product of the "fake news" media, there
are countless unknown incidents that the media hasn't covered -- tiny family tragedies that pit loved ones against each other.

p. 118.

## Chapter 8 - Save the Children: QAnon Transforms in 2020 With the Pandemic, pp. 123-139

- [None.]

## Chapter 9 - Memes at the Ready: The War Between QAnon and Social Media, pp. 142-158

QAnon was a perfect fit for social media.  It was active rather than passive; it was driven by decoding clues and solving puzzles;  it was
visually interesting; it was open to any number of interpretations; and it was spinning a web of lies that its believers were perfectly
happy to fall into.  QAnon certainly wasn't the first conspiracy theory to harness the power of the Internet for easy communication and
propagation.  But it was the first to exist almost entirely online, with no scientific knowledge or military expertise needed to understand
it -- just a hatred for the people Q hated, and the need for an online community that gave you praise and good feelings.

As a movement that began entirely online, QAnon probably wouldn't exist without social media.  It certainly wouldn't have spread so easily
without the tireless "work" of its biggest Twitter and YouTube influencers.  And it wouldn't be so viral in the mainstream Republican Party
if it hadn't been allowed to grow unchecked on Twitter, the platform of choice for Donald Trump's own conspiracy theory ideation.  It's
impossible to understand Q without understanding how it uses social media -- and how social media giants spent years allowing it to flourish
without oversight or accountability, only to see their laxity blow up in their faces.

p. 143.

## Chapter 10 - Change of Batter Coming? QAnon and the 2020 Election, pp. 159-177

Two [candidates for the US House of Representatives] picked up enough support in the primary to advance to the general election in districts
where they had a chance to win.  One was the Georgia CrossFit enthusiast and business owner Marjorie Taylor Greene, who called Q "a patriot
worth listening to among what would be revealed as an absolute blizzard of conspiracy theory posts on social media.  The other was the pistol-
packin' Colorado restaurant owner Lauren Boebert, who had made the rounds on conspiracy theoriest media after having public confrontations
over COVID-19 restrictions and guns.  Her Q allegiance came out soon after, with Boebert explaining on hardcore Q believer Ann Vandersteele's
YouTube show *Steel Truth,* "Everything that I've hear of Q, I hope that this is real, because it only means America is getting stronger and
better, and people are returning to conservative values."

Boebert and Greene were inexperienced newcomers who ran on a more local version of Donald Trump's outsider populism.  They won with small vote
totals in their primaries, running campaigns based on conspiracy theories and fear of an onslaught of socialism.  They even both attempted to
disavow QAnon at one point -- though not convincingly.  But their districts were solidly conservative, with Greene's so deeply red that a
Republican pudding cup would win an election there.  With onlookers shocked that two devotees of a crazy conspiracy cult could join Congress,
that's exactly what they did.  Nobody should have been shocked at this point.

p. 164.

The election was being stolen from the god emperor and handed to the decrepit basement-bound mummy Joe Biden, right in front of the world's
eyes.  Just like Q and Trump had said would happen.

The explosion of conspiracy theories after the election is impossible to separate from QAnon.  It represents the movement's biggest success
in its quest to troll the deep state into submission.  4chan and Twitter immediately became hives of disinformation related to voter fraud and
ballot rigging, shooting the "best" theories strait up the right-wing "disinfo" pyramid.  Q promoters on Twitter  (of whom there were still
hundreds, despite the site claiming to have cracked down in July) spun a new hope: Trump not only had won, but won in a four hundred-plus
Electoral College vote landslide.  But pretending to lose was necessary to sniff out and crush the fraud of the deep state.  Once the fraud
was revealed, everything would be fine.

Absent in all this was Q, beyond a couple of meaningless drops a few days after the election.  It was a cold and unforgiving silence that
left Q's countless acolytes desperate for answers and reassurance that everything would be okay.  And into that silence screamed Q's biggest
gurus -- grabbing control of the movement for good and never letting go.

"We're in day 2 of Joe Biden thinking he is president," declared Q promoter CJ Truth to hundreds of thousands of followers that Thursday....

p. 170.

Unsurprisingly, the concept of a peaceful transfer of power is not compatible with an election loser calling up the military and forcibly
seizing control.  And as the hope of a civil or legal miracle ebbed, violence became more and more inevitable.  In fact, it had already
started -- two men were arrested outside the Philadelphia Convention Center with gus and Q merchandise several days after the election for
allegedly conspiring to try to stop the vote count.  It was, of course, just a taste of what was to come (ironically, one of them would be
arrested again for violating their bail conditions after being caught at the Capitol insurrection).

p. 174.

## Chapter 11 - The Only Cult That Teaches You to Think for Yourself: What Experts Think QAnon I (and Is Not), pp. 181-197

One of the most frustrating aspects of telling the story of QAnon is that Q isn't just one thing.  It touches numerous different areas of
culture, politics, sociology, and technology.  Q's origins are completely rooted in American hucksterism and evangelical tropes -- yet it
can trace its lineage to both English and Russian anti-Semitism.  It's often called a cult, but it has no real leader.  Others see it as
a new prophetic religion -- but it has no clergy and relies on New Testament scripture as much as it does classified intelligence.  It has
puzzles to solve, yet offers no hint as to when you've solved them, nor does it eventually reveal those solutions.  Q claims to be a
military intelligence figure "saving the world," yet vanishes for months at a time.  It's a marketing grift that doesn't do enough to be
effective at either marketing or grift.  It's very slippery to pin down, but also fairly easy to understand.

To truly get Q means understanding it holds aspects of all these different disciplines -- and more -- without being any single one of them.
But why isn't it any single one of these things?  And if it's not, can we ever have any hope of understanding it?  What do the experts *in*
those fields think of Q?

p. 181.  [Emphasis in original.]

Dr. Alexandra Stein, one of the United Kingdom's foremost experts in social psychology and totalitarianism, was another top-tier thinker I
went to in order to find a simple answer for this complex question.  And just like Ross and Juergensmeyer, she didn't have one.

"I don't know, she explained with a smile when I asked her if QAnon was a cult, revealing how she herself was struggling with how to think
and write about the Q movement.  Stein touched on the same problem others have had: the issue of whether or not Q has a charismatic and
authoritarian leader.

p. 184.

Like QAnon, most cults don't make itimpossible to leave, instead casting the outside world as an evil and dangerous place that you don't
want to reenter.  "The driving force of a cult is fear, and Q is full of fear," she [Dr. Stein] continued.  "It keeps you revved up in
chronic anxiety, and you're isolated, so you can't go outside the system to a rational person."  There's a nameless terror outside the
closed circle of Q, "and even if you can't name it, it's a feeling.  The outside isn't a safe place, this is the only safe place."

The feelings of fear are never relieved or allowed to be processed in a healthy way, only intensified with more memes, more conspiracies,
and more enemies.  And the Q believer has pushed away the loved ones and friends who *could* help calm those feelings, leaving "rational
people unable to think for themselves."

p. 185.  [Emphasis in original.]

The theory that Russia has some hand in QAnon is usually brought up in conjunction with Russia's many other documented attempts to influence
American politics and culture, particularly the 2016 election.  If those are Russian active measures, why can't this one be that too?

On the surface, it's not an idea that can be dismissed outright.  Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager and a prolific lobbyist for
Russian interests, was indicted on charges of money laundering and criminal conspiracy by the Special Counsel's office on October 27, 2017,
and the first Q drop was made the next day -- theoretically the perfect distraction to keep the spotlight off Russian meddling.  News broke
just days before the 2020 election that Russia-backed Twitter acounts had been among the earliest boosters of Q, using sock-puppet accounts
to praise videos by early Q YouTube star Tracy "Beanz" Diaz and sharing Q hashtags.  The thousands of tweets these accounts put out represented
some of the earliest public acknowledgement of Q, with some made as early as a week after Q's first drops.

We already know that the Pizzagate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories were heavily promoted by the Russian disinformation machine, and many of
the same figures targeted by QAnon were linked to those earlier theories.

p. 192.

But to the cybersecurity researcher Brian Krebs, framing Russia as the driving force behind Q's success "seems like a pretty weak argument."

p. 193.

Essentially, Russia finds extant trends -- whether they're real stories like the Seth Rich murder, or 4chan goofs like Pizzagate going viral.
Russian trolls and bots work to boost these, rather than creating their own from scratch.  The polarization of social media and the instant
spread of conspiracy theories ensures they don't have to do more than grab onto the suspicions and fears already taking hold in our society.

And Russia's "psyops" have a goal, an objective beyond simply "causing chaos" or getting people to vote for Trump.  Q doesn't have that kind
of objective -- remember, it's based in a prophetic vision, not an action plan to bring that vision to reality.  Its believers up until
COVID-19 were almost entirely already rabid Trump supporters, and that only changed with the pandemic -- an event even Russia couldn't forecast.

p. 193.

**A Game That Plays Its Players**

QAnon is a cultish movement that's not quite a cult, a movement with prophetic elements that's not quite a religion, and a recipient of Russian
boosting that's entirely American.  And despite being decended from long-running frauds, it's not really a scam.

p. 196.

Q also has elements of a game -- puzzles to solve, enemies to fight, goals to achieve, characters to play.  But even the designers of alternative
reality games (ARGs), the kinds of difficult and fragmented [page break] interactive puzzles that have been on the Internet for decades, disagree
on how "gamified" Q is.

pp. 196-197.

Many of these arguments over what QAnon actually is -- is it a psyop or not, is it a cult or not, is it a game or not? -- depend on the profession
of the person making the argument.  Cult experts tend to see Q as a cult.  Game experts tend to see Q as a game.  Cybersecurity experts tend to
see Q as a cybersecurity issue.  But Q believers see it as a plan to save the world -- a plan being carried out by Donald Trump, his handpicked
advisors, and his millions of digital soldiers.

It doesn't matter that whatever that plan was, if failed.  No powerful liberals have been rounded up for arrest and execution, and Donald Trump
lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.  The issue is that Q's adherents don't believe either of those things, and that lack of belief in the basics
of reality has had devastating consequences for American politics.

Experts and scholars can have endless Twitter fights over what Q is and isn't -- but to a terrified GOP mainstream, beset by conspiracy theorists
and Q acolytes stringing up a noose on the Capitol front lawn, Q is their worst nightmare.  It's a political movement that revolves not around
patriotism or traditional conservative values, but bloody revenge against diabolical enemies.  Its voters demand loyalty, fealty, blood in the
streets, and the total overthrow of the political norms of the past.

p. 197.

## Chapter 12 - Mathematically Impossible: Debunking QAnon and Its Prophecies, pp. 199-215

**The Gospel of Q**

The closest thing to a founding document or scripture for Q are Q's drops themselves.  There are 4,953 of them posted just during the [page break]
Trump years , totalling 60,000 more word than the New Testament.

pp. 201-202.

Some almost salivate for violence ("These people need to ALL be ELIMINATED.  Those who know cannot sleep," screams Drop #2051 on August 31, 2018)
while others specifically claim that any violent act by a Q believer is fake (Drop #1797, posted just weeks earlier, calls media stories about
crimes committed by Q followers a "false 'violent' narrative push").  They are nakedly anti-Semitic and racist, referring to Barack Obama only by
his middle name of "Hussein."  But Q also declares on se en different occasions that patriotism has no skin color, and anyone who loves freedom
is welcome to join them in their quest.  And as we'll see below, they are full of false and vague claims, failed predictions, and assertions that
are so bizarre and counter to publicly known information that they specifically defy evidence and proof.

Taken together, the drops conjure a team of warriors fighting an unimaginably difficult battle against evil -- who happen to take months off at
a time and never actually accomplish anything of note.  At the darkest hour of the Q movement, when Trump looked to have lost the election Q
literally did nothing but post a Twisted Sister song -- after a year of pumping up that Biden could never and would never serve as president.
If Q is a field marshal leading an army of digital soldiers, then by extension, Q abandoned them in the field and rode off into the sunset with
the wounded and dying left behind.

This is the paradox that Q lays out -- a figure at the center of power who does nothing with that power other than tease that one day, they'll
actually do something with that power.

And for an elite team of operators, Q is also sloppy, making typos [page break] in drops and needing other drops to correct their mistakes, with
the excuse that they are "on the move."

pp. 203-204.

**No Proofs, No Pudding**

"#Qanon's intel drops are approved by President Trump and the proofs provided here will debunk any claims otherwise," reads the introduction to
QProofs.com, one of the many sites where these memes are collected (like many of the sources used in writing this book, QProofs went down, but is
still easily accessible on the Internet Archive.)  "Examining these proofs provided by Q and President Trump will convince the most skeptical
person who takes the time to examine them.  The proof if Q's legitimacy is undeniable and the information these drips have yielded is shocking
beyond belief."

Q proofs work under a principle that Q created, "Future proofs past," a phrase used three dozen times in Q drops.  This holds that events that
will unfold later will serve as evidence of Q having been correct beforehand.  It's a form of retroactive prediction that can turn the most
innocuous bit of text into incontrovertible evidence one something comes along that matches up with it -- which, given the vagueness and sheer
amont of text Q has written, is alwyas eventually going to be something.

p. 205.

**Literally Hitler**

Finally, much of Q's story is simply ripped off or plagiarized from other sources.  Q's long list of Rothschild central banks, which was copied
and pasted from a right-wing blog circa 2021, has quite a bit of company in being someone else's creation.

p. 213.

Adrenochrome as a superdrug, of course, is stolen from *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,* while many of Q's other foundational concepts and plot
points are grabbed from movies like *The Matrix* series and *The Godfather Part III.*

The idea of a popular uprising against the government carried out by armed patriots is coped from the seminal 1978 white supremacist novel *The
Turner Diaries,* where it's given the Q-esque name "the Day of the Rope."  Even the ver concept that kicked QAnon off, that of "the storm"
washing away the evil of the world, harkens back to Nazi iconography, with the earliest Nazi paramilitaries known as the SA, or Sturmabteilung,
literally meaning "Storm Detachment."  And the ideas found in "the storm" can be seen in later works highlighting violent vengeance against
perceived evildoers, such as *Taxi Driver* and the inexhaustible *Death Wish* and *Taken* series of films.

Like the debunking of Q drops or proofs, a list of Q's influences and nods to other media could go on nearly forever.  The point is that once
you start to see Q's component parts, they become all you can see.  You don't see a novel form of truth-telling, you see a hokey old story
dressed in the clothes of other stories and put in a shiny new box.

p. 214.  [Emphasis in original.]

## Chapter 13 - Where We Go One: How to Help People Who Want to Get Out of Q, pp. 217-234

*Try to unplug them* -- QAnon is almost an entirely digital movement, from its scriptures on 8kun to the message boards and social media sites
where believers communicate.  Because of that, experts are virtually unanimous that one critical aspect of helping people find a way out of Q
is to get them offline.

p. 223.

Would a plan to "save the world," as one popular Q video puts it, really rely on a barely usable imageboard that's full of racist memes and
pornography, utilizing tripcodes that could easily be broken as security?  Or ask about the times Q has gone silent, such as the three months
in 2019 when 8chan was down, or after Trump lost the 2020 election.  Do they think that's something an intelligence operation tasked with
saving children would do?  How did it make them feel to be abandoned by Q for such long stretches?

p. 226.

## Epilogue - Friends and Happy Memories pp. 235-246

But as QAnon envelops the GOP, the Q poster has receded into the background.  After the last drop, made on December 6, 2020 -- a now-dead link
to a Trump propaganda video -- Q went silent.  Maybe forever -- or maybe not.  Q might never make another drop, or Q might suddenly return and
make hundreds of drops, opening up vast new tranches of leads and clues for decoders and promoters to decode and promote.  Nobody knows, other
than whoever makes the drops.

p. 238.

And we might never know who that is, either.

To be clear, most of the experts I spoke to for this book, and most journalists who cover the disinformation beat in general, feel like we have
a pretty good idea of who made the first Q posts -- likely Paul Furber, with Coleman Rogers, or Tracy "Beanz" Diaz as possible accomplices.  It
was Furber's board that Q started to posted on [sic] once Q jumped to 8chan, while Rogers livestreamed himself accidentally logging in as Q,
and Dias made the first videos about QAnon that truly went viral.  As guesses go, they're the best ones we've got.

We also have a good idea of who made the bulk of the drops on 8chan/8kun -- someone directly connected to the Watkins family, and more than
likely Ron himself.  After all, there was no reason for Q to wait around for 8chan to come back in 2019 without some link to the Watkins family,
and Q went almost completely silent the moment Ron announced he'd left 8kun on Election Day 2020, with Ron spewing a slew of Q-esque tweets, only
to vanish as well.  The Ron-Q connection wasn't new, but revelations in HBO's docuseries *Q: Into the Storm* all but sealed Ron as the most likely
suspect.  For one, Ron and Q shared a number of hobbies, including a love of expensive watches and pens, both of which are featured in numerous Q
drops.  Ron also had a habit of using the same phrases Q did, had total control over the tripcodes used on the 8chan boards where Q posted, and
seemed to ensure that Q could post on the nascent 8kun when nobody else could -- which Ron chalked up to Q having "tried really hard."

Finally, Ron all but admitted his involvement with Q in *Into the Storm* director Cullen Hoback late in the last episode when he seemed to slip
up during an interview and claim his deluge of baseless voter fraud claims and invented expertise with voting machines were legit because he had
"three years of intelligence training, teaching normies how to do intelligence work.  It was basically what I was doing anonymously before, but
never as Q."  Naturally, he immediately claimed he wasn't Q, and has continued to do so on Telegram.

The "storm" prophesized by QAnon in those 4,953 drops might have passed.  But we know there will be another.  What it looks like and how to deal
with it will be unknown -- but it's coming.

## Glossary of QAnon Terms

*Trust the plan:* Another Q catchphrase, imploring believers to have faith that all will be well.  Phrases like this are also known as "thought-
terminating cliches."  More such cliches used by Q include "God wins," "nothing can stop what's coming," "enjoy the show," and "dark to light."
