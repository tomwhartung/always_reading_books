### From William of Norwich to Hunter S. Thompson

The Q movement has also worked hard to advance centuries-old traditions of blaming Jews for horrible crimes against innocent Christian
girls and boys.  This so-called blood libel -- named after an accusation in 1144 that a group of Jews ritually murdered and consumed
the blood of an English boy named William of Norwich -- has driven countless crimes against Jews, from organized pogroms in the Middle
Ages to social media harassment in the twenty-first century.  And a new version of it drives Q discourse now.

The modern blood libel takes the form of paranoia over "adrenochrome," a supposed superdrug extracted from the adrenal glands of
live children to confer eternal life to its consumers.  The term has never appeared in a Q drip, but adrenochrome is still referenced
constantly in the discourse of Q promoters, to the point where a number of major news outlets wrote about it in the struggle to
understand why so many people were getting sucked into Q.  Adrenochrome and Q fit together easily.

p. 53.

Both NESARA and the dinar were specifically mentioned as defrauding several of the Q believers profiled in a 2021 *Huffpost* story.
All the while, they stay addicted to what skeptics deem "hopium" -- the relentless and inexhaustible hope of a better future passed down
through secret knowledge.

Like the promises of QAnon, that future never arrives.  But unlike QAnon, the law could actually do something about these schemes.

p. 66.

## Chapter 5 - We Are the News Now: QAnon Has a Bit 2019, pp. 67-83

Over the next three months, Jim Watkins and his son, Ron, tried a number of different avenues to get their board back up and running,
rebranding it as "8kun" -- a name change meant to denote that the "chan," an honorific used in Japanese to express affection for babies,
children, and honored elders, had grown into a "kun," denoting an older and more respected person.  And after awhile the Watkinses
finally found a new web host -- a Vancouver, Washington, programmer named Nick Lim, who had founded the Internet service provider (ISP)
Bit Mitigate, which also hosted the neo-Nazi message board the Daily Stormer.  Lim did business by the motto "If it's legal, I don't care,"
and evidently, he didn't.  Because 8kun -- bringing with it all of the racism and anarchy of 8chan 00 was announced a few weeks later --
with security provided by Lim's company.

## Chapter 6 - God Wins: Why People Believe in QAnon, pp. 85-101

To any reasonable person, the failure of a long-foretold event erodes the belief that it will happen.  But belief isn't reasonable.  And
this stubborn lack of logic isn't limited to people who think the deep state is trying to murder their children.  We all have an innate
need to believe in good things that are extremely unlikely to take place.  It's the essence of hope.  Chicago Cubs fans spent an entire
century, one generation after another, insisting that maybe they'd win the World Series next year -- and every year they were let down.
Until the year they did win the World Series, that is.  Most Christians wait for the Second Coming of Christ, and century after century,
Christ does not come again.  This is not a sign of lunacy, it's the way belief works.  These things give people hope.  And a life without
hope is . . . hopeless.

Even when presented with crushing proof that they've been fooled, they still believe -- often taking the proof that they're wrong as proof
that they're actually right and are over the target.  To do otherwise would be to give in to hopelessness.

That's how it's gone with Q's precursors.  Even as local governments and law enforcement agencies putout notices warning people that the
dinar was a scam, and after numerous dinar brokers were indicted, dinar-guru message boards still pumped out "intel [page break] updates."
In 2018, the *Daily Beast* reported on Trump supporters who were making huge dinar purchases based on a cryptic comment from the president
that "all currencies would be on a level playing field" in his dealings with China.  During the COVID-19 lockdown, hundreds of thousands of
tweets mentioning NESARA were sent, while people claimed without evidence that their credit card debt and mortgages were suddenly vanishing,
and that the CARES Act -- passed by Congress in May to bolster the COVID-ravaged economy -- was actually the long-awaited release of
"prosperity packets."

As Q would say many times, "Nothing can stop what is coming.  Nothing."

**Another New Hope**

To understand why QAnon followers believe in spite of everything requires understanding why people believe in conspiracy theories in the
first place.

Human brains need to recognize dangerous situations, and we are hardwired to seek patterns, to find order in chaos, and to exert control
where none can be found.  Conspiracy theories, at their most basic level, assert that we are in danger from hidden forces.  This helps
give difficult questions and random events satisfying answers -- and puts us at the center of those events.  A person doesn't get cancer
because of some randomly misfiring cells -- they got it because of chemtrails or 5G Internet or microchips poisoning them.  [page break]
Our beloved candidate didn't lose an election because they ran a poor campaign -- they lost because of the conspiracy of a corrupt cabal
to keep them from power.  And on and on.

Our lives are often full of failure -- personal, professional, and collective.  We don't want to believe these failures are due to honest
mistakes by others or random chance.  And most of all, we don't want to believe that they're our own fault.  To believe otherwise is to
believe that either we screwed up, or that we have no control over what happens to us.  And that's just too horrible to accept.

"Conspiracy theories resonate with some of our brain's built-in biases and shortcuts, and tap into some of our deepest desires, fears, and
assumptions about the world and the people in it," writes author and psychologist Rob Brotherton in the introduction to his ground-breaking
book *Suspicious Minds: Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories.  "We are all natural-born conspiracy theorists."

Such beliefs don't begin with the Internet, nor are they more prevalent in the Internet age.  Decades of polling consistently show that
over half of Americans believe in some conspiracy theory, and that about as many people in 1963 believed that multiple assassins killed
JFK as they did in 2013.

As long as something major and unexpected takes place, there will be people who witness it and struggle to explain it.  In his book,
Brotherton goes all the way back to the years after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE to find the legendary Roman historian Tacitus writing
up rumors that gangs of thugs kept citizens from fighting the fires, and that the corrupt emperor Nero had set the devastating fire for
his own aims.

pp. 86-87.

**Conspiracies That Came True**

The balance between appreciating danger in the world around us and the unswerving faith in a conspiracy theory comes to a head in the
false equivalence between unproven theories and misdeeds that have been retroactively discovered.  To conspiracy theorists the latter are
considered "conspiracy theories that came true," and proof that whatever conspiracy currently being argued is also true.  But there is a
crucial difference between conspiracy theories and conspiracies.

p. 89.

Conspiracies, of course, are real.  Nobody disputes that....  [T]here have been plenty of instances when someone's else's misdeeds *did*
give people cancer -- but those misdeeds didn't involve chemtrails or 5G Internet poisoning, because those aren't real things.  Toxic
dumping, hiding carcinogens in food, polluting water, and the like actually give people cancer, and are carried out by major companies
all the time.  These are real things.

p. 89.  [Emphasis in original.]

[The author mentions the conspiracy to kill Ceasar in Rome and the one to kill President Lincoln, his Vice President, and Secretary of War.]
A conspiracy of German officers tried to kill Adolf Hitler in July 1944.  And the US Public Health Service engaged in a grossly unethical
four-decade conspiracy to withhold syphilis treatment from Black sharecroppers in Tuskegee, Alabama.

All of these are conspiracies.  But they are not "conspiracy theories that came true" because none were theorized in any specific way.
Nobody knew about them, and many were only revealed thanks to whistleblowers, the revelation of legal documents, or the arrests of [page
break] the conspirators.  Likewise, none of the widely held conspiracy *theories* so popular in today's discourse, from the supposed
poisonous spraying of chemtrails in the air to 9/11 being an inside job carried out by the US government, have ever been "revealed" as the
truth.  Their sheer size and scope make them all but impossible.

p. 89-90.  [Emphasis in original.]

But people believe the conspiracy theories because they fit in with the biases they already have about how the world "really" works.  As
we've seen, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  But for many Q believers, that nebulous feeling that *They're all out to get me* becomes
*They're all out to get me, and I'm going to get them first.*  This is the danger of Q -- not that people believe it, but that believing it
means that those who don't are the enemy.  And as we've seen again and again, [page break] from Hoover Dam to the Capito, it's extremely
dangerous.

For the Q believer, then, Q is not a conspiracy theory -- and many believers bristle at the term, calling themselves "conspiracy researchers"
instead.  And it provides its believers something nobody usually expects out of cultish conspiracy movements -- hope.

pp. 90-91.  [Emphasis in original.]

## Chapter 7 - This Is Not a Game: The Many Crimes of QAnon Followers, pp. 106-121

**Good and Evil**

An unseen war between right and wrong is pretty much the crux of QAanon.  I reached out to Professor [Mark] Juergensmeyer [of the University
of California, Santa Barbara] to ask if I was overreacting by drawing a parallel between QAnon and Al Qaeda or ISIS -- and it turns out, I
wasn't.

While Juergensmeyer believes that most Q believers will eventually move on to something else, "the exceptions are the dangerous ones."
Echoing the example of [1993 World Trade Center bomber] Mahmud Abouhalima, he continued that "these are the true believers who are willing
to risk their lives to undertake an act, which we see as terrorism, [that's] consistent with their ideologies."

"The secrecy is part of the potency.  It gives the followers a sense of smug satisfaction that they know something that everyone else does
not know.  Terrorist attacks are meant as much to assure the [page break] followers that there is a war going on as it is to shock the
imagined enemy," he went on.  And then he said something that made my stomach drop: "When the United states was attacked on 9/11 much of the
imact was due to the surprise -- not knowing who did this and why.  It is not inconceivable that QAnon followers could commit acts of this
magnitude."
