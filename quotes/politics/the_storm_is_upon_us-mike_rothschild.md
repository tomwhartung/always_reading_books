### From William of Norwich to Hunter S. Thompson

The Q movement has also worked hard to advance centuries-old traditions of blaming Jews for horrible crimes against innocent Christian
girls and boys.  This so-called blood libel -- named after an accusation in 1144 that a group of Jews ritually murdered and consumed
the blood of an English boy named William of Norwich -- has driven countless crimes against Jews, from organized pogroms in the Middle
Ages to social media harassment in the twenty-first century.  And a new version of it drives Q discourse now.

The modern blood libel takes the form of paranoia over "adrenochrome," a supposed superdrug extracted from the adrenal glands of
live children to confer eternal life to its consumers.  The term has never appeared in a Q drip, but adrenochrome is still referenced
constantly in the discourse of Q promoters, to the point where a number of major news outlets wrote about it in the struggle to
understand why so many people were getting sucked into Q.  Adrenochrome and Q fit together easily.

p. 53.

Both NESARA and the dinar were specifically mentioned as defrauding several of the Q believers profiled in a 2021 *Huffpost* story.
All the while, they stay addicted to what skeptics deem "hopium" -- the relentless and inexhaustible hope of a better future passed down
through secret knowledge.

Like the promises of QAnon, that future never arrives.  But unlike QAnon, the law could actually do something about these schemes.

## Chapter 5 - We Are the News Now: QAnon Has a Bit 2019, pp. 67-83

Over the next three months, Jim Watkins and his son, Ron, tried a number of different avenues to get their board back up and running,
rebranding it as "8kun" -- a name change meant to denote that the "chan," an honorific used in Japanese to express affection for babies,
children, and honored elders, had grown into a "kun," denoting an older and more respected person.  And after awhile the Watkinses
finally found a new web host -- a Vancouver, Washington, programmer named Nick Lim, who had founded the Internet service provider (ISP)
Bit Mitigate, which also hosted the neo-Nazi message board the Daily Stormer.  Lim did business by the motto "If it's legal, I don't care,"
and evidently, he didn't.  Because 8kun -- bringing with it all of the racism and anarchy of 8chan 00 was announced a few weeks later --
with security provided by Lim's company.

## Chapter 6 - God Wins: Why People Believe in QAnon, pp. 85-101

To any reasonable person, the failure of a long-foretold event erodes the belief that it will happen.  But belief isn't reasonable.  And
this stubborn lack of logic isn't limited to people who think the deep state is trying to murder their children.  We all have an innate
need to believe in good things that are extremely unlikely to take place.  It's the essence of hope.  Chicago Cubs fans spent an entire
century, one generation after another, insisting that maybe they'd win the World Series next year -- and every year they were let down.
Until the year they did win the World Series, that is.  Most Christians wait for the Second Coming of Christ, and century after century,
Christ does not come again.  This is not a sign of lunacy, it's the way belief works.  These things give people hope.  And a life without
hope is . . . hopeless.

Even when presented with crushing proof that they've been fooled, they still believe -- often taking the proof that they're wrong as proof
that they're actually right and are over the target.  To do otherwise would be to give in to hopelessness.

That's how it's gone with Q's precursors.  Even as local governments and law enforcement agencies putout notices warning people that the
dinar was a scam, and after numerous dinar brokers were indicted, dinar-guru message boards still pumped out "intel [page break] updates."
In 2018, the *Daily Beast* reported on Trump supporters who were making huge dinar purchases based on a cryptic comment from the president
that "all currencies would be on a level playing field" in his dealings with China.  During the COVID-19 lockdown, hundreds of thousands of
tweets mentioning NESARA were sent, while people claimed without evidence that their credit card debt and mortgages were suddenly vanishing,
and that the CARES Act -- passed by Congress in May to bolster the COVID-ravaged economy -- was actually the long-awaited release of
"prosperity packets."

pp. 85-86.  [Ellipsis in original.]

As Q would say many times, "Nothing can stop what is coming.  Nothing."

**Another New Hope**

To understand why QAnon followers believe in spite of everything requires understanding why people believe in conspiracy theories in the
first place.
