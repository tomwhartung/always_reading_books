### From William of Norwich to Hunter S. Thompson

The Q movement has also worked hard to advance centuries-old traditions of blaming Jews for horrible crimes against innocent Christian
girls and boys.  This so-called blood libel -- named after an accusation in 1144 that a group of Jews ritually murdered and consumed the
blood of an English boy named William of Norwich -- has driven countless crimes against Jews, from organized pogroms in the Middle Ages
to social media harassment in the twenty-first century.  And a new version of it drives Q discourse now.

The modern blood libel takes the form of paranoia over "adrenochrome," a supposed superdrug extracted from the adrenal glands of live
children to confer eternal life to its consumers.  The term has never appeared in a Q drip, but adrenochrome is still referenced constantly
in the discourse of Q promoters, to the point where a number of major news outlets wrote about it in the struggle to understand why so many
people were getting sucked into Q.  Adrenochrome and Q fit together easily.

p. 53.

Both NESARA and the dinar were specifically mentioned as defrauding several of the Q believers profiled in a 2021 *Huffpost* story.  All the
while, they stay addicted to what skeptics deem "hopium" -- the relentless and inexhaustible hope of a better future passed down through
secret knowledge.

Like the promises of QAnon, that future never arrives.  But unlike QAnon, the law could actually do something about these schemes.
