Highlights from the book Purple Cow, 2002, by Seth Godin.

p. 16 Bottom line?
- All the obvious targets are gone, so people aren't likely to have easily solved problems.
- Consumers are hard to reach because they ignore you.
- Satisfied customers are less likely to tell their friends
The old rules don't work so well anymore.  Marketing is dead.  Long live marketing.

p. 23 Before and After
TV-Industrial Age    | Post-TV Age
---------------------|------------
Average Products     | Remarkable Products
Advertise to Anyone  | Advertise to the Early Adopter
Fear of Failure      | Fear of Fear
Long Cycles          | Short Cycles
Small Changes        | Big Changes

p. 35 Getting In
[Discussing the bell-shaped curve with:
- Innovators - at the tip of the far left-most segment
- Early Adopters - in the remainder of the far left-most segment
- Early and Late Majority - take up the bulk of the curve
- Laggards - in the far right-most segment]
It is so tempting to skip the left[-most segment of the bell-shaped curve]
and go for the juicy center.  But that doesn't work anymore.

p. 58 [The Problem With the Cow]
You do not equal the prject.  Criticism of the project is *not* criticism of you.
The fact that we need to be reminded of this points to how unprepared we are for
the era of the Cow.  It's people who have projects that are *never* criticized
who ultimately fail.
- Emphasis in original.

p.87 The Parody Paradox
- How could you modify your product or service so that you'd show up on the next
episode of Saturday Night LIve or in a spoof of your industry's trade journal.

p. 90 Case Study: Curad
- Could you make a collectible version of your product?
