Notes and quotes fro The Practice, Shipping Creative Work, by Seth Godin, 2020.
===============================================================================

Do the work, become the artist.  Instead of planning, simply become.  Acting as if is how we acquire identity.
- p. 34.

Artists have a chance to make things better by making better things.  Contributing work to those whom they serve.  Turning
on lights, opening doors, and helping us not only connect to our better nature, but to one another.
Industrialists seek to make what's requested, and to do it ever cheaper and faster.  But people who have found their voice
are able to help us see that life includes more than what's requested.
You're not a short-order cook.  You're here to lead us.
- p. 46.

The first thing is making exactly what you want, for you.
And the second thing is making something for those you seek to connect to change.
Pursuing *either* is fine.  Pursuing *both* is a recipe for unhappiness, because what you're actually doing is insisting
that other people want what you want and see what you see.
Most of us would like that -- we might even deserve it after al the work we invest -- but that doesn't mean it's likely to
happen.
