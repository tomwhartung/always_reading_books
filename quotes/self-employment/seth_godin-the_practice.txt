Notes and quotes fro The Practice, Shipping Creative Work, by Seth Godin, 2020.
===============================================================================

Do the work, become the artist.  Instead of planning, simply become.  Acting as if is how we acquire identity.
- p. 34.

Artists have a chance to make things better by making better things.  Contributing work to those whom they serve.  Turning
on lights, opening doors, and helping us not only connect to our better nature, but to one another.
Industrialists seek to make what's requested, and to do it ever cheaper and faster.  But people who have found their voice
are able to help us see that life includes more than what's requested.
You're not a short-order cook.  You're here to lead us.
- p. 46.

62. And Maybe You're Trying to Do Two Things at Once
The first thing is making exactly what you want, for you.
And the second thing is making something for those you seek to connect to change.
Pursuing *either* is fine.  Pursuing *both* is a recipe for unhappiness, because what you're actually doing is insisting
that other people want what you want and see what you see.
Most of us would like that -- we might even deserve it after al the work we invest -- but that doesn't mean it's likely to
happen.
- p. 74.  [Emphasis in original as *italics.*]

102. Who Can You Reach?
How is it possible for three cowboys to herd a thousand cattle?
Easy.  They don't.
They herd ten cattle, and those cattle influence fifty cattle and those cattle influence the rest.
That's the way every single widespread movement/product/service has changed the world.
And so we ignore all the others.  we ignore the masses and the selfish critics and those in love with the status quo.
First, find ten.  Ten people who care enough about your work to enroll in the journey and then bring others along.
- p. 123.

[Summarizing the chapter entitled "Intent:"]
128. Intentional Action Has a Few Simple Elements
1. Determine who it's for.  Learn what they believe, what they fear, and what they want.
2. Be prepared to describe the change you seek to make.  At least to yourself.
3. Care enough to commit to making that change.
4. Ship work that resonates with the people it's for.
5. Once you know whom it's for and what it's for, watch and learn to determine whether your intervention succeeded.
6. Repeat.
- p. 150.

The internet is our enemy when it comes to mise en place because we cannot see what it will bring us, unbidden, as we sit to do
our work.  For me, email is the trap, but it might be anything on your phone that beeps or tweets or vibrates.
The internet brings uninvited energy, positive and negative, to the work we set out to do.  It opens an infinite spigot of new
ideas, new tools, and new people for the project.
If you want to create your work, it might pay to turn off your wi-fi for a day.  To sit with your tools and your boundaries and
your process and nothing else.
There is time to engage with the world after we do our work, but right now, we fill the cup and we empty the cup.  We sit and
type and then we type some more.
- p. 186.

170. "How Do I Make This Better?" is Different than "How Do I Make This?"
That's the way our culture works.  It's easy to get a committee together to criticize the new logo that your agency put together.
It's almost impossible to find someone willing to make the logo itself.
We're a ommunity of critics and tweakers and tinkerers.
The reason is simple: it's safer.  People rarely criticize the critic.  And beyond that, it's not that hard to use sandpaper.  It's
a lot more difficult to use a bandsaw, or even to use a pencil to draw the plans in the first place.
There's a huge clue here about what to do next: *get a pencil.*
That's what's scarece.  People who will draw up plans.  People who will go first.
After that, you can easily get help from one of the people who are good at using sandpaper, now that you've done just about all of the
scary bits.

[Summarizing the chapter entitled "No Such Thing As Writer's Block:"]
181. A Roundup of Tips and Tricks for Creators
o Build streaks.  Do the work every single day.  Blog daily.  Write daily.  Show up daily.  Find your streak and maintain it.
o Talk about your streaks to keep honest.
o Seek the smallest viable audience.  Make it for someone, not everyone.
o Avoid shortcuts.  Seek the most direct path instead.
o Find and embrace genre.
o Seek out desireable difficulty.
o Don't talk about your dreams with people who want to protect you from heartache.
- p. 205.

194. None of Us Can Be Superman
Superman got boring.  Every time Siegel and Shuster got him into a jam, or if the readers got bored, they added a new
superpower.
X-ray vision, flight, time travel, orange kryptonite, heat vision -- these were added long after Clark was a kid in
Smallville.
The problem with the model of the well-rounded superhero is [page break] that there are very few well-rounded superheroes.
It's much more likely that we'll succeed by overinvesting in just one or two skills.  If we can do this without becoming a
diva or sacrificing resilience, we have a chance to make a real contribution.
The challenge, then, is to have one superpower.  All out of balance to the rest of your being.  If, over time, you develop
a few more, that's fine.
Begin with one.
- pp. 223-224.
