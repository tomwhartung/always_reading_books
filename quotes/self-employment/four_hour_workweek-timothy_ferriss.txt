COMFORT CHALLENGE
Use the Criticism Sandwich (2 Days and Weekly)
Chances re good that soeone - be it a co-worker, boss, customer, or significant other - does something
irritating  or at a subpar level.  Rather than avoid the topic out of fear or confrontation, let's
chocolate-coat it and ask them to fix it.  Once per day for two days, and then each Thursday (M-W is
too tense and Friday is too relaxed) for the next three weeks, resolve to use what I call the Criticism
Sandwich with someone.  It's called the Criticism Sandwich because you first **praise** the person for
something, then **deliver** the **criticism,** and then close with topic-shifting **praise** to exit
the sensitive topic.  Here's an example with a superior or boss, with keywords and phrases in italics.
 - p. 148 [emphasis in original].

**It Should Cost the Customer $50-200.**
The bulk of companies set prices in in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is.  Pricing
low is shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive
you both bankrupt.  Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-
end image an charging more than the competition.
1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units - and thus manage fewer customers - and fulfill our
dreamlines.  It's faster.
2. Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer
returns, etc.).  It's less  headache.  This is HUGE.
3. Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins.  It's safer.

The Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks.
It's time to obliterate the cult of the exper.  Let the PR world scorn me.  First and foremost, there is
a difference between **being perceived** as an expert and **being** one.  In the context of business, the
former is what sells product and the latter, relative to your "minimal customer base," is what creates
good products and prevents returns.
It is possible to know all there is about a subject - medicine, for example - but if you don't have M.D.
at the end of your name, few will listen.  The M.D. is what I term a "credibility indicator."
 - p. 170.

[Some suggestions for gaining "credibility snowball effect."]
1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official-sounding names....
2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic (search historical New York Times bestseller lists
online) and summarize each on one page.
3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to
advertize.  Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM, etc.) lo-[page break]
cated in the same area....
4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing what
you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility.  If they decline, offer to interview a known
exper and write the article - it still gets your name listed as a contributor.
5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles.  Getting
PR is simple if you stop shouting and start listening.  Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility
and online research to respond to journalist queries.  Done properly, this will get you featured in media
ranging from small local publications to the New York Times and ABC News.
Becoming a recognized expert isn't difficult, so I want to remove that barrier now.
I am not recommending pretending to be something you're not.  I can't!  "Expert" is nebulous media-speak
and so overused as to be indefinable.  In modern PR terms, proof of expertise is most fields is shown with
group affiliations, client lists, writing credentials, and media mentions, not IQ points or Ph.D.s
Presenting the truth in the best light, but not fabricating it, is the name of the game.
See you on CNN.

Find Yoda (3 Days) [Site: www.contactanycelebrity.com]
Call at least one potential superstar mentor per day for three days.  E-mail only after attempting a phone
call.  I recommend calling before 8:30 A.M. or after 6:00 P.M. to reduce run-ins with secretaries and
other gatekeepers.  Have a single question in mind, one that you have researched but have been unable to
answer yourself.  Shoot for "A" players - CEOs, ultrasuccessful entrepreneurs, famous authors, etc. - and
don't aim low to make it less frightening.  Use www.contactanycelebrity.com if need be, and base your
script on the following.
Unknown answerer: This is Acme Inc. [or "the office of Mentor X"].
You: Hi, this is Tim Ferriss calling for John Grisham, please.
Answerer: May I ask what this is regarding?
You: Sure.  I know this might sound a bit odd, but I'm a first-time author and I just read his interview in
 Time Out New York.  I'm a longtime fan and have finally built up the courage to call him for one specific
 piece of advice.  It wouldn't take more than two minutes of his time.  Is there any way you can help me
 [page break] get through to him?
Answerer: Hmmm...  Just a second.  Let me see if he's available.  [two minutes later]  Here you go.  Good
luck.  [rings to another line]
John Grisham: John Grisham here.
You: Hi, Mr. Grisham.  My name is Tim Ferriss.  I know this might sound a bit odd, but I'm a first-time
 author and a longtime fan.  I just read your interview in Time Out New York and finally built up the courage
 to call.  I have wanted to ask you for a specific piece of advice for a long time, and it shouldn't take
 more than two minutes of your time.  May I?
John Grisham: Uh...  OK.  Go ahead.  I have to be on a call in a few minutes.
You: (at the very end of the call): Thank you so much for being so generous with your time.  If I have the
 occasional tough question - very occasional - is there any chance I could keep in touch via email?
