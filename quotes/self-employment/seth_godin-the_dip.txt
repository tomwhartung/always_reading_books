Highlights from the dip: the little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick) 2007

p.9 The Reason Number One Matters
[The short head vs. the long tail.]
[T]he rewards for being first are enormous.  It's not a linear scale.
It's not a matter of getting a little more after giving a little more.
It's a curve, and a steep one.

pp. 32-33 Superstar Thinking
Superstars get what they want because they have unique skills....
Being better than 98 percent of the competition used to be fine.
In the world of Google, though, it's useless, because all of your
competition is just a click away, whatever it is you do.
The only position you can count on now is best in the world.

p. 47 Salespeople Who Quit
I think the lesson of the story is this: Selling is about transference
of emotion, not a presentation of facts.

p. 64 Pride Is the Enemy of the Smart Quitter
Richard Nixon sacrificed tens of thousands of innocent lives (on both sides)
when he refused to quit the Vietnam War.
