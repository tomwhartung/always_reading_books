Quotes From Deep Work by Cal Newport, 20xx
------------------------------------------
I keep thinking about "intermittent variable rewards!"  Why didn't I get that quote?!?

Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on
values like quality, craftmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned
and non-technological.
  - Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 69.

[Social networking sites] offer personalized information arriving on an
unpredictible intermittent schedule - making them massively addictive and
therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and
succeed with any act of concentration.
  - Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 205.

But part of what makes social networking insidious is that the companies
that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing
coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you
might <em>miss out</em>.
  - Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 206.  [Emphasis in original.]

[Cal discusses how before the internet, traditional media - books,
newspapers, radio, film, tv - were heavily curated by the publishers.
Using social media, anyone can publish anything without fear of an
editor's modifications.  Examples: songs such as The Pill and Wake Up,
Little Susie, The Hayes Code, Uhura's and Kirk's kiss, and so on.]
Part of what fueled social media's rapid ascent, I contend, is its ability
to short-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real
value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has
instead replaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow
collectivist alternative: <em>I'll pay attention to what you say if you
pay attention to what I say - regardless of value</em>.
  - Deep Work by Cal Newport, p. 207.  [Emphasis in original.]
