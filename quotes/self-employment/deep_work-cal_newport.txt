Notes and quotes from Deep Work, Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, by Cal Newport, 2016.
=======================================================================================================

I keep thinking about "intermittent variable rewards!"  Why didn't I get that quote?!?

Introduction - p. 1
-------------------
Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallownesss and you *permanently* reduce your capacity to perform
deep work.  "What the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and concentration,"
admitted journalist Nicholas Carr, in an oft-cited 2008 *Atlantic* article.  "[And] I'm not the only one."
Carr expanded this argument  into a book, *The Shallows,* which became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
To write *The Shallows,* appropriately enough, Carr had to move to a cabin and forcibly disconnect.
- p. 7.  [Emphasis in original as *italics.*]

**The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasing *rare* at exactly the
same time it is becoming increasingly *valuable* in our economy.  As a consequence, the few who cultivate this
skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
- p. 14.  [Emphasis in original as *italics* and **bolded text.**]

Part I: The Idea - p. 19
========================
Chapter One: Deep Work Is Valuable - p. 21
------------------------------------------
Chapter Two: Deep Work Is Rare - p. 49
--------------------------------------
Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftmanship,
and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and non-technological.
- p. 69.

Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful - p. 72
----------------------------------------------

Part II: The Rules - p. 93
==========================
Rule #1: Work Deeply - p. 95
----------------------------
Rule #2: Embrace Boredom - p. 115
---------------------------------
Rule #3: Quit Social Media - p. 181
-----------------------------------
The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to
concentrate.  This reality no longer generates much debate; we all feel it.
- p. 182.

To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many
diversion that attempt to steal them.
- p. 182.

I won't ask you, in other words, to quit the Internet altogether like Baratunde Thurston did for twenty-five days
back in 2013.  But I will ask you to reject the state of distracted hyperconnectedness that drove him to that
drastic experiment in the first place.  There is a middle ground, and if you're interested in developing a deep
work habit, you must fight to get there.
- p. 184.

**The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:** You're justified in using a network took of you can
identify *any* possible benefit to its use, or *anything* you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it.
- p. 186.  [Emphasis in original as *italics* and **bolded text.**]

**The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:** Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in
your professional and personal life.  Adopt a took only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially
outweigh its negative impacts.
- p. 191.  [Emphasis in original as **bolded text.**]
Notice that this craftsman approach to tool selection stands in opposition to the any-benefit approach.  Whereas
the any-benefit mind-set identifies any potential positive impact as justification for using a tool, the craftsman
variant requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of what's important to you and that they
outweigh the negatives.
- p. 191.

The three strategies that follow in this rule are designed to grow your comfort with abandoning the any-benefit
mind-set and instead applying the more thoughtful craftsman philosophy in curating the tools that lay claim to
your time and attention.  This guidance is important because the craftsman approach is not cut-and-dry.  Identifying
what matters most in your life, and then attempting to assess the impacts of various tools on these factors, doesn't
reduce to a simple formula -- this task requires practice and experimentation.  by forcing you to reconsider your
network tools from many different angles.  Combined, they should help you cultivate a more sophisticated relationship
with your tools that that will allow you to take back enough control over your time and attention to enable the rest
of the ideas in Part 2 to succeed.
- p. 192.

[First strategy.]
Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits [heading]
- p. 192.

**The Law of the Vital Few:** In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible
causes.
- p. 201.  [Emphasis in original as **bolded text.**]

[Second strategy.]
Quit Social Media [heading]
- p. 203.

In more detail, this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a packing party on the social media services that
you currently use.  Instead of "packing," however, you'll instead ban yourself from using them for *thirty days.*  All
of them: Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine -- or whatever services have risen to popularity [page
break] since I first wrote these words.  Don't formally deactivate these services, and (this is important) don't mention
online that you'll be signing off: Just stop using them, cold turkey.  If someone reaches out to you by other means and
asks why your activity on a particular service has fallen off, you can explain, but don't go out of your way to tell
people.
After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the
services you temporarily quit:
  1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?
  2. Did people care that I wasn't using this service?
- pp. 204-205.  [Emphasis in original as *italics.*]

[Social networking sites] offer personalized information arriving on an
unpredictible intermittent schedule - making them massively addictive and
therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and
succeed with any act of concentration.
- p. 205.

But part of what makes social networking insidious is that the companies that profit from your attention have succeeded
with a masterful marketing coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you might *miss out*.
- p. 206.  [Emphasis in original as *italics.*]

The reason why I ask you to not announce your thirty-day experiment is because for some people another part of the delusion
that binds them to social media is the idea that people *want to hear what you have to say,* and that they might be
disappointed if you suddenly leave them bereft of your commentary.
- p. 206.  [Emphasis in original as *italics.*]

[Cal discusses how before the internet, traditional media - books, newspapers, radio, film, tv - were heavily curated by the
publishers.  Using social media, anyone can publish anything without fear of an editor's modifications.  Examples that I am
aware of, but that he does not mention, include songs such as The Pill and Wake Up, Little Susie, The Hayes Code, Uhura's and
Kirk's kiss, and so on.]
Part of what fueled social media's rapid ascent, I contend, is its ability to short-circuit this connection between the hard
work of producing real value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has instead replaced this
timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow collectivist alternative: *I'll pay attention to what you say if you pay attention
to what I say - regardless of value*.
- p. 207.  [Emphasis in original as *italics.*]

[Second strategy.]
Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself [heading]
- p. 209.

These sites are especially harmful after the workday is over, where the freedom in your schedule enables them to become central
to your leisure time.  If you're waiting in line, or waiting to finish eating a meal, they provide a cognitive crutch to ensure
you eliminate any chance of boredom.  As I argued in Rule #2, however, such behavior is dangerous, as it weakens your mind's
general ability to resist distraction, making deep work difficult later when you really want to concentrate.
- p. 212.

Rule #4: Drain the Shallows - p. 215

Conclusion - p. 257
