Notes and quotes from Digital Minimalism, Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World, by Cal Newport, 2019

## Partial Read -- So Far

**Note:** So far, I have only read the Introduction an first two chapters of this book.

## Introduction -- pp. xi-xx

In my work on this topic, I've become convinced that what you need instead [of "minor corrections, willpower, tips, and
vague resolutions"] is a full-fledged **philosophy of technology use,** rooted in your deep values, that provides clear
answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to
confidently ignore everything else.
- p. xvi.  Emphasis in original as italics.

Of the different philosophies I studied, however, there was one in particular that stood out as a superior answer for those
looking to thrive in our [page break] current moment of technological overload.  I call it **digital minimalism,** and it
applies the believe that **less can be more** to our relationship with digital tools.

## Chapter 1, A Lopsided Arms Race -- pp. 3-25

... on May 12, 2017, when Maher looked into the camera and said:
> The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they're friendly nerd gods building a better world
> and admit they're just tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children.  Because, let's
> face it, checking your "likes" is the new smoking.

"This thing is a slot machine," ["former start-up founder and Google engineer" Tristan] Harris says early in the interview
[with Anderson Cooper on a segment of **60 Minutes** entitled "Brain Hacking"] while holding up his smartphone.
"How is that a slot machine?" Cooper asks.
"Well, every time I check my phone, I'm playing the slot machine to see 'What did I get?'" Harris answers.  "There's a whole
playbook of techniques that get used [by technology companies] to get you using the product for as long as possible."
"Is Silicon Valley programming apps or are they programming people?" Cooper asks.
"They are programming people," Harris says.  "THere's always this narrative that technology's neutral.  And it's up to us to
choose how we use it.  This is just not true --"
"Technology is not neutral?" Cooper interrupts.
"It's not neutral.  They want you to use it in particular ways and for long periods of time.  Because that's how they make their
money."
- p. 10.

"Phillip Morris just wanted your lungs," Maher concludes.  "The App Store wants your soul."
- p. 11.

To many people, **addiction** is a scary word.  In popular culture, it conjures images of drug addicts stealing their mother's
jewelry.  But to psychologiests, addiction has a careful definition that's stripped of these more lurid elements.  Here's a
representative example:
> Addiction is a condition in which a person engages in use of a substance or in a behavior for which the
> rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeatedly pursue the behavior despite detrimental
> consequences.
Until recently, it was assumed that addiction only applied to alcohol or drugs: substances that include psychoactive compounds
that can directly change your brain chemistry.  As the twentieth century gave way to the twenty-first, however, a mounting body
of research suggested that behaviors that did not involve ingesting substances could become addictive in the technical sense
defined above.
