Notes and quotes from Digital Minimalism, Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World, by Cal Newport, 2019

## Partial Read -- So Far

**Note:** So far, I have only read the Introduction an first two chapters of this book.

## Introduction -- pp. xi-xx

In my work on this topic, I've become convinced that what you need instead [of "minor corrections, willpower, tips, and
vague resolutions"] is a full-fledged *philosophy of technology use,* rooted in your deep values, that provides clear
answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to
confidently ignore everything else.
  - p. xvi.  Emphasis in original as *italics.*

Of the different philosophies I studied, however, there was one in particular that stood out as a superior answer for those
looking to thrive in our [page break] current moment of technological overload.  I call it *digital minimalism,* and it
applies the believe that *less can be more* to our relationship with digital tools.

## Chapter 1, A Lopsided Arms Race -- pp. 3-25

... on May 12, 2017, when Maher looked into the camera and said:
> The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they're friendly nerd gods building a better world
> and admit they're just tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children.  Because, let's
> face it, checking your "likes" is the new smoking.
  - p. 9.

"This thing is a slot machine," ["former start-up founder and Google engineer" Tristan] Harris says early in the interview
[with Anderson Cooper on a segment of *60 Minutes* entitled "Brain Hacking"] while holding up his smartphone.
"How is that a slot machine?" Cooper asks.
"Well, every time I check my phone, I'm playing the slot machine to see 'What did I get?'" Harris answers.  "There's a whole
playbook of techniques that get used [by technology companies] to get you using the product for as long as possible."
"Is Silicon Valley programming apps or are they programming people?" Cooper asks.
"They are programming people," Harris says.  "THere's always this narrative that technology's neutral.  And it's up to us to
choose how we use it.  This is just not true --"
"Technology is not neutral?" Cooper interrupts.
"It's not neutral.  They want you to use it in particular ways and for long periods of time.  Because that's how they make their
money."
  - p. 10.

"Phillip Morris just wanted your lungs," Maher concludes.  "The App Store wants your soul."
  - p. 11.

To many people, *addiction* is a scary word.  In popular culture, it conjures images of drug addicts stealing their mother's
jewelry.  But to psychologists, addiction has a careful definition that's stripped of these more lurid elements.  Here's a
representative example:
> Addiction is a condition in which a person engages in use of a substance or in a behavior for which the
> rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeatedly pursue the behavior despite detrimental
> consequences.
Until recently, it was assumed that addiction only applied to alcohol or drugs: substances that include psychoactive compounds
that can directly change your brain chemistry.  As the twentieth century gave way to the twenty-first, however, a mounting body
of research suggested that behaviors that did not involve ingesting substances could become addictive in the technical sense
defined above.

In his 2017 book, *Irresistable,* which details his study of this topic, [Adam] Alter explors the many different "ingredients"
that make a given technology likely to hook our brain and cultivate unhealthy use.  I want to briefly focus on two forces from
this longer treatment that not only seemed particularly relevant to our discussion, but as you'll soon learn, repeatedly came up
in my own research on how tech companies encourage behavioral addiction: *intermittent positive reinforcement* and *the drive for
social approval.*
Our brains are highly susceptible to these forces.

\- p. 17.  Emphasis in original as *italics.*


We begin with the first force: intermittent positive reinforcement.  Scientists have known since Michael Zeiler's famous pecking
pigeon experiments from the 1970s that rewards delivered unpredictably are far more enticing than those delivered wtih a known
pattern.

\- p. 17.


As whistleblower Tristan Harris explains: "Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because
it's good for business."

\- p. 19.


In perhaps the most telling admission of all, in the fall of 2017, Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, spoke candidly
at an event about the attention engineering deployed by his former company:
> The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, ... was all
> about: "How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?"  And that means that we
> need to give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo
> or a post or whatever.

\- p. 19.


In other words, there's nothing fundamental about the unpredictable feedback that dominates most social media services.  If you took
these features away, you probably wouldn't diminish the value most people derive from them.  The reason this specific dynamic is so
universal is because it works really well for keeping eyes glued to screens.  These powerful psychological forces are a large part of
what Harris had in mind when he held up a smartphone on *60 Minutes* and told Anderson Cooper "this thing is a slot machine."

## Chapter 2, Digital Minimalism -- pp. 27-58
As I mentioned in the introduction, I have one such philosophy to propose:
> **Digital Minimalism**
>
> A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected
> and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything
> else.

\- p. 28.  Emphasis in original as **bold.**


My argument for this philosophy's effectiveness  rests on the following three core principles:
> **Principle #1:** *Clutter is costly.*
> Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and
> services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individutal item
> provides in isolation.
[page break]
> **Principle #2:** *Optimization is important.*
> Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only
> the first step.  To truly extract its full potential benefit, it's necessary to think carefull about
> *how* they'll use the technology.

> **Principle #3:** *Intentionality is satisfying.*
> Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional
> about how they engage with new technologies.  This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific
> decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to
> its practitioners.
