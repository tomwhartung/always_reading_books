-----------------------------------------------------------
Note that How to Publish Your Book is published The Great Courses, and as such

These quotes are from the Course Guidebook.

*Writer's Market* is the longest continuously published market listings guide.  It includes more than
7,500 listings of markets that pay writers, including book publishers, magazines, literary journals, and
contests.  It's also released in specialized editions by genre, such as *Novel and Short Story's Market*
and *Guide to Literary Agents.*  The listings are vetted and updated regularly.

As you take stock of your platform as a nonfiction author, evaluate your strengths in the following areas:
- Publishing or distributing quality work in media outlets with which you want to be identified and that
your target audience reads.
- Producing a body of work on your own turf that gathers followers, such as a website and blog, e-mail
newsletter, podcast, or video series.
- Being active and visible on social media.
- Speaking at events that your target audience or community attends.
- Partnering with peers or influencers to produce creative projects or extend your visibility.

Because platform building is an organic process, it will grow differently for every author, but in general,
platform has six components:
- Your writing or content that's publicly available, including all of your traditionally published work, self-
published work, and online writing.
- Your social media presence, including the mainstream sites (Twitter, Facebook), as well as online communities
and message boards where you're active.
- Your website; this is usually critical for any ongoing platform activity because it acts as the hub for all
your efforts.
- Your relationships, including the people you know personally, as well as devoted readers.

- Your influence, that is, your ability to get people you don't know to help you out or pay attention to you.
- Your reach -- the number of people you can reliably broadcast a message at any given time.
In platform building, it's important to remember that you are communicating directly with readers.  Be consistent
with your voice and style; don't adopt a "marketing voice" that's different from your real voice.  Also, focus on
what's satisfying and engaging.  Publish, post, and share things that fascinate or puzzle you, or ask questions
for others to answer.
The people you reach, either online or off, will be at different stages of commitment to you and your work.  For
this reason, your communication should be segmented by audience as much as possible.  In particular, two types of
readers deserve special attention: people who are new to your work and true fans who would buy anything you published.
For the first group, offer something for free, such as the first book in a series or a special digital download.  For
the second, consider providing exclusive communications and experiences, such as early access to new work.

[Book] Proposals vary in length, content, approach, and presentation.  Each book requires a unique argument for its
existence -- or, a specific business case -- and, thus, requires a unique proposal.  However, all book proposals must
answer three strategic marketing questions: So what?  Who cares?  Who are you?
- The answer to the first question is essentially the reason for your book's existence -- the unique selling proposition
that sets your book apart from others on the market.
- The answer to the second question describes your target readership and the size of your audience.
- The answer to the third question addresses your authority or credentials to write the book and the existence of an
appropriate platform that makes you visible to the target audience.
In preparing a book proposal, keep in mind that editors who work at commercial publishers care about to things: a viable
idea with a clear market, paired with a writer who has credibility and marketing savvy.  Knowing your audience or market
and having direct and specific ways to reach it gives you a much better chance of success.  Pitch only the book you know
has a firm spot in the marketplace.  Don't pitch a book with the expectation that the publisher will bring the audience
to you.

Also, you don't need to put the copyright symbol anywhere on your work for it to be protected under the law.  But if you
self-publish your work or otherwise distribute it publicly, then you should officially register it with the U. S. Copyright
office.
