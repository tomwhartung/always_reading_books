*Writer's Market* is the longest continuously published market listings guide.  It includes more than
7,500 listings of markets that pay writers, including book publishers, magazines, literary journals, and
contests.  It's also released in specialized editions by genre, such as *Novel and Short Story's Market*
and *Guide to Literary Agents.*  The listings are vetted and updated regularly.

As you take stock of your platform as a nonfiction author, evaluate your strengths in the following areas:
- Publishing or distributing quality work in media outlets with which you want to be identified and that
your target audience reads.
- Producing a body of work on your own turf that gathers followers, such as a website and blog, e-mail
newsletter, podcast, or video series.
- Being active and visible on social media.
- Speaking at events that your target audience or community attends.
- Partnering with peers or influencers to produce creative projects or extend your visibility.
 - p. 54.

Because platform building is an organic process, it will grow differently for every author, but in general,
platform has six components:
- Your writing or content that's publicly available, including all of your traditionally published work, self-
published work, and online writing.
- Your social media presence, including the mainstream sites (Twitter, Facebook), as well as online communities
and message boards where you're active.
- Your website; this is usually critical for any ongoing platform activity because it acts as the hub for all
your efforts.
- Your relationships, including the people you know personally, as well as devoted readers.

- Your influence, that is, your ability to get people you don't know to help you out or pay attention to you.
- Your reach -- the number of people you can reliably broadcast a message at any given time.
In platform building, it's important to remember that you are communicating directly with readers.  Be consistent
with your voice and style; don't adopt a "marketing voice" that's different from your real voice.  Also, focus on
what's satisfying and engaging.  Publish, post, and share things that fascinate or puzzle you, or ask questions
for others to answer.
The people you reach, either online or off, will be at different stages of commitment to you and your work.  For
this reason, your communication should be segmented by audience as much as possible.  In particular, two types of
readers deserve special attention: people who are new to your work and true fans who would buy anything you published.
For the first group, offer something for free, such as the first book in a series or a special digital download.  For
the second, consider providing exclusive communications and experiences, such as early access to new work.
 - pp. 57-58.

[Book] Proposals vary in length, content, approach, and presentation.  Each book requires a unique argument for its
existence -- or, a specific business case -- and, thus, requires a unique proposal.  However, all book proposals must
answer three strategic marketing questions: So what?  Who cares?  Who are you?
- The answer to the first question is essentially the reason for your book's existence -- the unique selling proposition
that sets your book apart from others on the market.
- The answer to the second question describes your target readership and the size of your audience.
- The answer to the third question addresses your authority or credentials to write the book and the existence of an
appropriate platform that makes you visible to the target audience.
In preparing a book proposal, keep in mind that editors who work at commercial publishers care about to things: a viable
idea with a clear market, paired with a writer who has credibility and marketing savvy.  Knowing your audience or market
and having direct and specific ways to reach it gives you a much better chance of success.  Pitch only the book you know
has a firm spot in the marketplace.  Don't pitch a book with the expectation that the publisher will bring the audience
to you.

Also, you don't need to put the copyright symbol anywhere on your work for it to be protected under the law.  But if you
self-publish your work or otherwise distribute it publicly, then you should officially register it with the U. S. Copyright
office.

As mentioned earlier, Writer Beware is an important online hub for writers who have concerns about any publisher, service,
or organization in the writing community.  *The Independent Publishing Magazine* by Mick Rooney is a website that regularly
reviews and discusses new self-publishing and digital services for writers.  It's one of the rare resources that is
comprehensive and objective about this sector of the industry.

Finally, consider the following timeless factors when your [sic] revisiting your writing career and making decisions about
your next steps forward:
- What makes you happy?  Happiness is the reason you got into writing in the first place.  Even if you put it on the back
burner to advance other aspects of your writing career, don't leave it out of the equation for long.  Otherwise, your efforts
can come off as mechanistic or uninspired, and you'll eventually burn out.
- What earns you money?  Not everyone cares about earning money from writing, and writers who are looking to become rich
should probably find another field.  But as you gain experience, the choices you make in this regard become more important.
The more professional you become, the more you [page break] must pay attention to what brings the most return on your investment
of time and energy.
- What reaches readers or grows your audience?  Sometimes, you'll want to make trade-offs that involve earning less money to
grow readership because doing so is an investment in the future.  For example, some industry conferences don't pay speakers, but
they put you in front of important insiders or influencers in your community.
In the end, if you believe that you can't stop writing even if someone tells you that it's a waste of time or won't get you a
deal, then you're much closer to publication than another writer who is easily discouraged.

A Writer's Dilemmas
First, are you creating primarily for yourself or primarily for an audience?
- . . .
- . . .
- . . .
Second, how much of yourself will you share with readers?
- Having a readership necessitates some kind of persona or brand....  When you're able to express your reasons for writing, you're
on your way to developing an identity or brand for yourself as an author.
- As humans, we tend to be most strongly attracted to people who are producing work from a deep place, rather than from a
superficial drive to make money or become famous.  Look at some of the most remarkable author brands, and you'll often find people
who exhibit a strong core belief system throughout their work.
 - p. 117.

It's important to note that independent bookstores also play a role in turning a book into a bestseller.  The American Booksellers
Association, a professional organization for independent booksellers, holds regular conventions that are also attended by publishers;
some publishers bring along some of their authors who they believe have the potential to break out if supported by the independent
bookseller community.
- The power of *hand-selling* -- when bookstore staffs make personal recommendations to their customers -- can also play a pivotal
role in a new author's success.  Such recommendations may be more likely to happen if the booksellers meet the author at an industry
convention or otherwise get more personal insight into an upcoming title.
- For these and other reasons, some authors go out of their way to support independent bookstores as part of a book launch or overall
marketing campaign.  Some will even adopt an independent bookstore to be their fulfillment center for anyone who wants to find a signed
copy.  Such relationships help both the bookstore and the book generate more buzz.

Author Websites
An essential task for any author today is to establish a website that serves as a hub and information clearinghouse for everything he or
she publishes.  A website serves as your primary calling card in the digital age.  Whatever type of marketing strategy you pursue, it
will be more effective with a website in place.
There's some truth to the belief that a bad website or an out-of-date website can be more damagingthan no site at all, but most authors
are quite capable of constructing and maintaining sites after being educated properly.  Further, no site has to be perfect at launch.
Authors can start small and build their skills and presence over time.  It may even be worthwhile for an unpublished writer to start a
website.
- Starting a site when you're unpublished helps you get over the learning curve....
- Also, having a site helps slowly extend brand awareness, especially if you're active on social media or elsewhere online.  This tends
to be particularly important for nonfiction authors [page break] who are building their authority and reach in order to persuade a
publisher to offer a contract.
- Finally, having a site opens up opportunities....

If you're an unpublished author, your site needs only one or two pages.  Include a short bio, mention any credits or media appearances,
link to your social media accounts, and briefly describe the type of writing work you do.  Don't belabor your unpublished status.
- Your professional bio should run about 100 or 200 words.  You may also include a professional head shot if you have one or another good photo.
- You might include a tagline or description in your site header that clearly describes your brand....
- Next, you should have a page dedicated to your published or forthcoming books.  You might have a separate page for each book or product, or
you might combine them.  Regardless, don't skimp on the details, and always include links to where your books can be purchased in both print and
digital form.
- Always let readers know where else you're active online....
- You should also mention notable media coverage, good reviews, testimonials, or a significant following you have on another platform.  Such
positive attention constitutes *social [page break] proof,* that is, it sends out strong signals that other people have found your writing
worthwhile.
 - pp. 143-144.

Facebook is not an adequate replacement for an author website for a number of reasons....

If you're comfortable with very little to no service, you can use the major services that distribute POD specifically for self-published
authors, such as Amazon's CreatSpace and IngramSpark.  With these services, which are virtually free, you can often see your book for sale
at major online retailers in as little as 48 hours.
This entire process becomes simpler if you plan to self-publish and distribute your book only in e-book format.  E-book services typically
fall into two categories.
- First, there are retailer-specific distribution and sales services that are 100 percent free to use, such as Amazon's Kindle Direct
Publishing.  As an author, you work directly through a self-service interface to make your work available for sale almost [page break]
instantly.  It's as simple as opening an account, uploading your book files, and pushing the "Publish" button.
- Also available are e-book distribution services, such as Smashwords.  They offer a centralized site to upload your work, which they then push
out to all the major online e-book retailers.  Some e-book distributors charge an upfront fee, while others take a percentage of your sales.
- Understand that these services are not publishers.  They are distributors and retailers  They take no responsibility for the quality of your
work, but neither do they take any rights to your work.  You use these services on an at-will basis.  If you decide you've made a mistake in
publishing your e-book, you can remove it from availability as quickly as you uploaded it.
 - pp. 152-153.

When using an e-book retailer or service, keep the following pointers in mind:
- First, check to see if the retailer or service is exclusive or nonexclusive.  Most work on a nonexclusive basis, which means that you can
sell your e-book at many different retailers at once.
- Second, you should always be in control of the price.  Although some retailers may have reasonable pricing restrictions, such as not allowing
you to price below $0.99, the standard practice is to give the author control over pricing.  However, most e-book retailers mandate that you not
offer more favorable pricing elsewhere.
- Third, you should always understand how much money you'll earn on each book sale.  For example, Amazon Kindle offers you 70 percent of your
book's list price as long as you price between $2.99 and $9.99.  If you price outside that range, you'll earn 35 percent.
- Fourth, make sure you understand how much freedom you have to make changes to your e-book after it goes on sale.  Retailers [page break]
generally allow you to upload revised files as often as you like, but distributors may require you to pay a fee to make changes.
- Finally, check what formats are required from you.  Most retailers allow you to upload a Word document, which is automatically converted into
whatever format is needed.  Most services offer guidelines and preview programs to ensure that your e-book looks good before it goes live.
 - pp. 153-154.

- With giveaways, independent authors may run into trouble if they have only one or two books to sell and nothing else to offer readers or if
they don't establish any means to contact readers in the future, whether via e-mail newsletter or social media.  The other catch is that the
quality of your work must match the expectations of your audience.  If it doesn't no amount of giveaways will help you.
- Whether you use KDP Select or not, giveaways can be an effective part of a larger marketing strategy.  But before you use them, make aure you
understand your reader funnel and the demand curve for your work.
 - p. 159.

Garnering Reviews
In addition to leading to visibility and new readers, giveaways can also result in more reviews for your work, and getting a good number of
reviews early on can tip the scales in your favor.  Although no one knows what the Amazon algorithm favors, most authors see that once they have
around 60 or 70 reviews, the visibility of their books on Amazon is improved.  It's also well-known that readers make buying decisions based on
the content of the reviews.
