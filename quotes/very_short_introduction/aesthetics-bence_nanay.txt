Non-elitist aesthetics
....
The experiences that aesthetics talks about come on a spectrum.  We care
more about some experiences more than others.  Not just the experience of
artworks in a museum or of an opera performance.  Also the experience of
the autumn leaves in the park on our way home after work or even just the
light of the setting sun falling on the kitchen table.  But aesthetics is
also about your experience when you choose the shirt you're going to wear
today or when you wonder whether you should put more pepper in the soup.
Aesthetics is everywhere.  It is one of the most important aspects of our life.
- p. 2.

Beauty?
The most widely shared take on aesthetics is that it's about beauty.
Just look around on the street -- the word `aesthetics' routinely shows up
in beauty salons....  The general thought is that some things are beautiful
others are not.  Aesthetics helps us to keep them apart....

I call this the `beauty-salon approach' because in cosmetic surgery or the
nail business there are fairly clear conceptions of what is beautiful and
what is not.  In fact, the main aim is to turn something not-so-beautiful
into something more beautiful....

The beauty-salon approach solves the sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll problem
with little effort.  Aesthetic experiences are experiences of beautify things.
Drug-induced experiences or sexual experiences, or the experience of rock 'n'
roll, are not of beautiful things.  So they won't count as aesthetic.
- p. 8.

The point is that beauty is not a feature of objects that remains the same
at all times, in all contexts. for all observers....  [A]s Oscar Wilde
rightly noted, we sometimes see an object as beautiful sometimes we don't....
Even if beauty is in the eye of the beholder -- even if it is `objective' in
some sense, itis highly sensitive to what context we encounter it in.  The
beauty-salon approach can't explain this context-sensitivity.
- p. 9.

Pleasure?
....  The general thought is that aesthetics is about pleasure.  The
non-aesthetic is not....
Not all pleasure is aesthetic....
