==========================================================================

Chapter 1 - Lost in the Museum
------------------------------
Non-elitist aesthetics
....
The experiences that aesthetics talks about come on a spectrum.  We care
more about some experiences more than others.  Not just the experience of
artworks in a museum or of an opera performance.  Also the experience of
the autumn leaves in the park on our way home after work or even just the
light of the setting sun falling on the kitchen table.  But aesthetics is
also about your experience when you choose the shirt you're going to wear
today or when you wonder whether you should put more pepper in the soup.
Aesthetics is everywhere.  It is one of the most important aspects of our life.
- p. 2.

Chapter 2 - Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll
-----------------------------------------
Beauty?
The most widely shared take on aesthetics is that it's about beauty.
Just look around on the street -- the word `aesthetics' routinely shows up
in beauty salons....  The general thought is that some things are beautiful
others are not.  Aesthetics helps us to keep them apart....

I call this the `beauty-salon approach' because in cosmetic surgery or the
nail business there are fairly clear conceptions of what is beautiful and
what is not.  In fact, the main aim is to turn something not-so-beautiful
into something more beautiful....

The beauty-salon approach solves the sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll problem
with little effort.  Aesthetic experiences are experiences of beautify things.
Drug-induced experiences or sexual experiences, or the experience of rock 'n'
roll, are not of beautiful things.  So they won't count as aesthetic.
- p. 8.

The point is that beauty is not a feature of objects that remains the same
at all times, in all contexts. for all observers....  [A]s Oscar Wilde
rightly noted, we sometimes see an object as beautiful sometimes we don't....
Even if beauty is in the eye of the beholder -- even if it is `objective' in
some sense, itis highly sensitive to what context we encounter it in.  The
beauty-salon approach can't explain this context-sensitivity.
- p. 9.

Pleasure?
....  The general thought is that aesthetics is about pleasure.  The
non-aesthetic is not....
Not all pleasure is aesthetic.
- p. 11.

Psychologists make a distinction between two kinds of pleasure.  The first
kind of pleasure is what you feel when something unpleasant stops.  I call
this `relief pleasure' because it is triggered by the body returning to its
normal state after a period of perturbation....

Relief pleasure is short-lived....

Contrast this with what I will call `sustaining pleasure.'  Sustaining
pleasure motivates us to keep on doing what we are doing -- it sustains
our activity....

Aesthetic pleasure is typically sustaining pleasure.
- p. 12.

Chapter 3 - Experience and attention
------------------------------------
The difference attention makes
Remember *Goldfinger?*  It wasw one of the better James Bond films (made
in 1964)....

It's an old film, but if you've seen it recently, say in the last couple of
years, it's impossible not to notice the uncanny resemblance between the look
of the villain Goldfinger and, well, the 45th president of the US.

Once you've seen this similarity, it's very difficult to unsee it.  And it
really messes with your mind when you watch the movie, especially given that
Goldfinger blows up the federal gold reserve in order to increase the value
of his own gold holdings.  For me, at least, this now takes a lot away from
the enjoyment of the film.
- p. 22.

Attending to the similarity between Goldfinger and Donald J. Trump can make
a huge difference....  This highlights the importance of which features of
the artwork we pay attention to.  Paying attention to an irrelevant feature
could and would derail our experience.
- p. 23.

This trick [revealing something at the end that changes everything] has been
widely used in feature films.  One way of getting the audience to spend even
more money on a film is to get them to watch it again.  And films of certain
aspirations do this by [page break] revealing something at the very end that
changes everything, so much so that, seeing the film for the second time,
knowing what you known now, will be a very different experience.  Christopher
Nolan's *Memento* (2000) and *Inception* (2010) are famous examples, but there
are many others.  You have very little idea what's going on until the end.
And when you see these films for the second time, you see them very differently,
because you attend to very different features of the story.
