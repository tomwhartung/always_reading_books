==========================================================================

Chapter 1 - Lost in the Museum
------------------------------
Non-elitist aesthetics
....
The experiences that aesthetics talks about come on a spectrum.  We care
more about some experiences more than others.  Not just the experience of
artworks in a museum or of an opera performance.  Also the experience of
the autumn leaves in the park on our way home after work or even just the
light of the setting sun falling on the kitchen table.  But aesthetics is
also about your experience when you choose the shirt you're going to wear
today or when you wonder whether you should put more pepper in the soup.
Aesthetics is everywhere.  It is one of the most important aspects of our life.
- p. 2.

Chapter 2 - Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll
-----------------------------------------
Beauty?
The most widely shared take on aesthetics is that it's about beauty.
Just look around on the street -- the word `aesthetics' routinely shows up
in beauty salons....  The general thought is that some things are beautiful
others are not.  Aesthetics helps us to keep them apart....

I call this the `beauty-salon approach' because in cosmetic surgery or the
nail business there are fairly clear conceptions of what is beautiful and
what is not.  In fact, the main aim is to turn something not-so-beautiful
into something more beautiful....

The beauty-salon approach solves the sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll problem
with little effort.  Aesthetic experiences are experiences of beautify things.
Drug-induced experiences or sexual experiences, or the experience of rock 'n'
roll, are not of beautiful things.  So they won't count as aesthetic.
- p. 8.

The point is that beauty is not a feature of objects that remains the same
at all times, in all contexts. for all observers....  [A]s Oscar Wilde
rightly noted, we sometimes see an object as beautiful sometimes we don't....
Even if beauty is in the eye of the beholder -- even if it is `objective' in
some sense, itis highly sensitive to what context we encounter it in.  The
beauty-salon approach can't explain this context-sensitivity.
- p. 9.

Pleasure?
....  The general thought is that aesthetics is about pleasure.  The
non-aesthetic is not....
Not all pleasure is aesthetic.
- p. 11.

Psychologists make a distinction between two kinds of pleasure.  The first
kind of pleasure is what you feel when something unpleasant stops.  I call
this `relief pleasure' because it is triggered by the body returning to its
normal state after a period of perturbation....

Relief pleasure is short-lived....

Contrast this with what I will call `sustaining pleasure.'  Sustaining
pleasure motivates us to keep on doing what we are doing -- it sustains
our activity....

Aesthetic pleasure is typically sustaining pleasure.
- p. 12.

Chapter 3 - Experience and attention
------------------------------------
The difference attention makes
Remember *Goldfinger?*  It wasw one of the better James Bond films (made
in 1964)....

It's an old film, but if you've seen it recently, say in the last couple of
years, it's impossible not to notice the uncanny resemblance between the look
of the villain Goldfinger and, well, the 45th president of the US.

Once you've seen this similarity, it's very difficult to unsee it.  And it
really messes with your mind when you watch the movie, especially given that
Goldfinger blows up the federal gold reserve in order to increase the value
of his own gold holdings.  For me, at least, this now takes a lot away from
the enjoyment of the film.
- p. 22.

Attending to the similarity between Goldfinger and Donald J. Trump can make
a huge difference....  This highlights the importance of which features of
the artwork we pay attention to.  Paying attention to an irrelevant feature
could and would derail our experience.
- p. 23.

This trick [revealing something at the end that changes everything] has been
widely used in feature films.  One way of getting the audience to spend even
more money on a film is to get them to watch it again.  And films of certain
aspirations do this by [page break] revealing something at the very end that
changes everything, so much so that, seeing the film for the second time,
knowing what you known now, will be a very different experience.  Christopher
Nolan's *Memento* (2000) and *Inception* (2010) are famous examples, but there
are many others.  You have very little idea what's going on until the end.
And when you see these films for the second time, you see them very differently,
because you attend to very different features of the story.
- .pp 26-27.

Chapter 4 - Aesthetics and the self

....  We take our aesthetic preferences to be a big part of who we are.

But these preferences change surprisingly quickly and often without us noticing.
According to some recent findings, aesthetic preferences are the most stable in
middle-aged people and they are much more fluid in younger and, somewhat
surprisingly, older age groups.  But even the aesthetic preferences of people in
the most stable age group undergo at least one major change as often as every two
weeks in an aesthetic domain they really care about.

We like to think that we don't change much.  Or if we do, we are in control of
this change.  But we are spectacularly wrong about this.  We have very little
control over how and how much we change.

Take the example of a widely explored psychological phenomenon, the `mere exposure
effect.'  The more you are exposed to something, the more you tend to like it.
Just the mere exposure to something changes your preferences.  And this happens
even if you are not aware of what you are exposed to.

The mere exposure effect influences your like of people, songs, colours, even
paintings.  In one experiment, a professor of psycholog at Cornell put some
seemingly random pictures among the slides for....
- p. 44.

Our aesthetic preferences in music, film, food, clothing, and art are super-
important for us, and they can and do change in a way that we have no control
over....  It happens under the radar.

If our preferences can be hijacked without us noticing, then a big part of who
we are seems to be the product of random mere exposure.  And we are defenceless
against this.
- p. 45.

Going global
The vast majority of aesthetic traditions outside the `West' are not too
concerned with aesthetic judgements at all.  They are concerned with how our
emotions unfold, they way our perception is altered, and the way aesthetic
engagement interacts with social engagement.
- p. 54.

Chapter 5 - Aesthetics and the other
Aesthetic agreements and disagreements
It is somewhat unfortunate that the discussion of the social dimension of
aesthetics in the history of `Western' aesthetics has been dominated by one
question only, that of aesthetic agreements and disagreements.
- p. 56.

Here are two obvious options for settling disagreements of this kind.  We
can agree to disagree.  You like this, I like that.  Neither of us is right,
or, rather, we are both right.  The other option is that one of us is just
dead wrong.  The plausibility of these two options will depend on which
examples we pick.
- p. 57.

Aesthetics is not for policing
It is not that a certain artwork just demands you to have a certain aesthetic
reaction.  Rather, when you have an aesthetic reaction, you implicitly assume
that everybody else has, or at least should have, the same reaction....

... this is one of the most arrogant ideas in the history of aesthetics.  If
you implicitly assume that everybody else should have the same reaction as
you do, then you seriously underappreciate the diversity of humankind and
the diversity of the cultural backgrounds people come from.  And any time we
are even tempted to think (or assume or feel) that whatever we do has universal
appeal or universal communicability, that would be a good time to stop and
exercise what I call `aesthetic humility' -- thinking about just how contingent
our own position and cultural background is compared to the vast diversity of
cultures on this planet.
