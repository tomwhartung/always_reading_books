# Notes and Quotes From The War of Art

By Steven Pressfield, 2002.

## Book One - Resistance: Defining the Enemy, pp. 1-57

- "The enemy is a very good teacher." -- the Dalai Lama

p. 3.

### Resistance and Self-Medication

I once worked as a writer for a big New York ad agency.  Our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease.
Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure.

Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder.  These aren't diseases,
they're marketing ploys.  Doctors didn't discover them, copywriters did.

Depression and enxiety may be real.  But they can also be Resistance.

When we drug ourselves to blot out our soul's call, we are being good Americans and exemplary consumers.
We're doing exactly what TV commercials and pop materialist culture have been brainwashing us to do from birth.
Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard work, we simply consume a product.

Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.

p. 26.

### Resistance and Love

Resistance is directly proportional to love.  If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means
there's a tremendous amount of love there too.  If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't
feel anything.  **The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference.**
- p. 42.  [Emphasis added.]

## Book Two - Combating Resistance: Turning Pro, pp. 59-101

- "It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life." -- Telamon of Arcadia, mercenary of the fifth century B.C.

p. 61.

### A Professional Is Patient

The professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the stars time to align in his career, but to keep himself from
flaming out in each individual work.  **He knows that any job, whether it's a novel or a kitchen remodel, takes twice as long as
he thinks and costs twice as much.**  He accepts that.  he recognizes it as reality.

p. 75.  [Emphasis added.]

### A Professional Accepts No Excuses

The professional knows that Resistance is like a telemarketer; if you so much as say hello, you're finished.  The pro doesn't even
pick up the phone.  He stays at work.

p. 80.

### A Professional Self-Validates

The professional cannot allow the actions of others to define his reality.  Tomorrow morning the critic will be gone, but the writer
will still be there facing the blank page.  Nothing matters but that he keep working.  Short of family [page break] crisis or the
outbreak of World War II, the professional shows up, ready to serve the gods.

Remember, Resistance wants us to cede sovereignty to others.  It wants us to stake our self-worth, our identity, our reason-for-being,
on the response of others to our work.  Resistance knows we can't take this.  No one can.

**The professional blows critics off.**  He doesn't even hear them.  Critics, he reminds himself, are the unwitting mouthpieces of
Resistance and as such can be truly cunning and pernicious.  They can articulate in their reviews the same toxic venom that Resistance
itself concocts inside our heads.  That is their real evil.  Not that we believe them, but that we believe the Resistance in our own
minds, for which critics serve as unconscious spokespersons.

**The professional learns to recognize envy-drivien criticism and to take it for what it is: the supreme compliment.**  The critic
hates most that which he would have done himself if he had had the guts.

pp. 92-93.  [Emphasis added.]

## Book Three - Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm, pp. 103-165

- "The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and pray them to grant you the thoughts, words, and deeds likely to render your command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends, and your city the fullest measure of affection and glory and advantage." -- Xenophon, The Cavalry Commander

p. 105.
