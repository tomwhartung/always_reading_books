# Notes and Quotes From The War of Art

By Steven Pressfield, 2002.

## Book One - Resistance: Defining the Enemy, pp. 1-57

- "The enemy is a very good teacher." -- the Dalai Lama

p. 3.

### Resistance and Self-Medication

I once worked as a writer for a big New York ad agency.  Our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease.
Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure.

Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder.  These aren't diseases,
they're marketing ploys.  Doctors didn't discover them, copywriters did.

Depression and enxiety may be real.  But they can also be Resistance.

When we drug ourselves to blot out our soul's call, we are being good Americans and exemplary consumers.
We're doing exactly what TV commercials and pop materialist culture have been brainwashing us to do from birth.
Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard work, we simply consume a product.

Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.

p. 26.

### Resistance and Love

Resistance is directly proportional to love.  If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means
there's a tremendous amount of love there too.  If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't
feel anything.  **The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference.**
- p. 42.  [Emphasis added.]

## Book Two - Combating Resistance: Turning Pro, pp. 59-101

- "It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life." -- Telamon of Arcadia, mercenary of the fifth century B.C.

p. 61.

## Book Three - Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm, pp. 103-165

- "The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and pray them to grant you the thoughts, words, and deeds likely to render your command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends, and your city the fullest measure of affection and glory and advantage." -- Xenophon, The Cavalry Commander

p. 105.
