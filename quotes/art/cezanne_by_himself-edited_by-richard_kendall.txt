Quotes from Cezanne by Himself, edited by Richard Kendall, 1988, 1994.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: I read only the Introduction to this book.

Picasso, who was probably more indebted to Cezanne than to any other single artist, once insisted that it was
Cezanne's anxiety that impressed him above all.  His contemporary Matisse, writing of a small Cezanne canvas he
owned, claimed that it had "sustained me spiritually in the critical moments of my career as an artist," but
went on to admire "the exceptional sobriety of its relationships."
- p. 8.

Paul Cezanne has been celebrated as the greatest of the Impressionist generation, as the artist who laid the
foundations of Cubism and as the father of abstract art and the modern movement.
- p. 8.

Cezanne is still considered by many to be a 'difficult' artist, whose sometimes awkward, often unfinished, and
occasionally distressing imagery has never endeared itself to the wide public that has conspicuously adopted
contemporary figures such as Claude Money, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Vincent Van Gogh.  Cezanne's reputation as
an 'artist's artist', or as a painter whose very complexity attracts those of a theoretical disposition, is a
forbidding one.
- p. 8.

As the only son of a rising middle-class family, he enjoyed an untroubled childhood, a privileged education and,
ultimately, a financially secure maturity.
- p. 9.

Cezanne's vocation as a artist came slowly and met with little encouragement.  As his earliest surviving letters
show, he struggled with his studies at the College Bourbon in Aix, finally matriculating in 1858.  For a while he
joined the life-drawing classes at the Aix Drawing Academy, learning to master the orthodox figure conventions of
the day, but family pressures soon obliged him to enrol [sic] as a student of law [!!!] at the University.  Cezanne's
family, particularly his father, was to have an exaggerated influence on his career, and it was with the greatest
reluctance that the only son was allowed to consider becoming an artist.  The family fortune had been built on banking,
and Louis-Auguste Cezanne had decided that a legal training for his son would be the best guarantee of their continuing
prosperity.
- p. 9.

Cezanne's determination to follow his own path is dramatically evident in his earliest surviving pictures, the drawings
and paintings from the 1860s which caused such consternation in Paris.  An audience accustomed to the work of his
maturity can still be shocked by these scenes of nakedness, rape and murder, the awkward groupings of clothed and
unclothed figures, the lugubrious portraits and oleaginous still lifes.
- p. 9.

It can hardly surprise us that these early paintings were rejected by the official Salon, but each rejection both
distressed Cezanne and increased his belief in his own independent vision.
- p. 10.

By the early 1870s much of the pattern of Cezanne's life was already established.  He worked remoreslessly at his art,
attracting few admirers and fewer purchasers.  Depending still on his allowance from his father, he regularly spent time
in Aix and its vicinity, but increasingly found the family atmosphere unsympathetic.  Matters became worse when he met a
young model, Hortense Fiquet, and began to live secretly with her in Paris.  In 1872 Hortense gave birth to a son,
christened Paul after his father, and an elaborate system of deception was developed to keep news of the liason and its
offspring from the family at Aix.
