Notes and Quotes from Cezanne's Composition, Analysis of His Form With Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs, by Erle Loran, 1943.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This book really helped me understand how Cezanne inspired the Cubists!  In particular, the photographs of his motifs -- especially
those of The Sainte Victoire mountain -- juxtaposed with his paintings let to a real "Ah-ha" moment!

THE FUNCTION OF LINE AND MODULATING.  In John Rewald's book, in a chapter entitled "Theories artistiques de Cezanne," the author
quotes from Balzac's novel, *Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu,* a passing in which, as he says, the hero, Frenhofer, expounds a theory of
drawing that is surprisingly close to the meaning of the quotations I have cited from Cezanne.  It is well established that Cezanne
felt a deep emotional identification with Frenhofer.  It is my opinion that Cezanne's contradictory opinions in some measure owe
their origin to this identification.
Frenhofer explains: "I have not dryly traced out the outer contours of my figure and made every little anatomical detail stand out,
because the human body doesn't end in lines....  [Ellipsis in original.]  Strictly speaking, drawing does not [page break] exist ...
[ellipsis in original] line is the means by which man gets a clear idea about the effect of light on objects; but there is no line
in nature, there everything is full: it is in modeling that one draws, that is to say that one detaches things from their surroundings,
the distribution of light alone is what gives the true semblance of things! ...  [Ellipsis in original.]  Perhaps one should not draw a
single feature; it might be better to approach a figure at the center, beginning first at the protuberances nearest the light, passing
on to the more shaded parts.  Doesn't the sun proceed in this way, that divine painter of the universe?"
Regardless of the many statements Cezanne has made that are similar to the theories expounded by Balzac's character, his actual procedure
in painting was quite different.  For example, instead of beginning at the highlights of forms, Cezanne began with the dark at the outer
contours.  He modulated gragually toward the light, painting with chromatic gradations.  We know this because, in a typical unfinished
painting, the protruding part of the volumes is often left entirely unpainted (Plate XXXVIII).  Almost all the water colors tell the same
story.
