# Notes and Quotes From Aesthetics - A Very Short Introduction

By Bence Nanay, 2019.

## Chapter 1, Lost in the museum - pp. 1-6

### Non-elitist aesthetics

Aesthetics is about some special kinds of experiences.  Ones we care a lot about.

p. 2.

The experiences that aesthetics talks about come on a spectrum.  We care about some experiences more than others.

p. 2.

It is not the job of aesthetics to tell you which artworks are good and which ones are bad.

p. 3.

### Aesthetics or philosophy of art?

Aesthetics is not the same as philosophy of art.  Philosophy of art is about art.  Aesthetics is about many things - including art.
But it is also about our experience of breathtaking landscapes or the pattern of shadows on the wall opposite your office.

p. 4.

### Non-'Western' aesthetics

Artifacts have been made everywhere in the world.  Music too.  Stories as well.  Nonetheless, when you go into almost any major
museum in the world, you are likely to encounter objects made in the 'West' (Europe and, if it's a museum or modern art, maybe
[page break] also North America - I will use scare-quotes around 'West' throughout the book to indicate that the 'West' is obviously
not a unitary concept).

pp. 5-6.

Sticking to the European line on aesthetics would be as biased as exhibiting only European artworks in a museum.

p. 6.

## Chapter 2, Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll - pp. 7-21

Philosophers often contrast the experience of art with drug-induced and sexually charged experiences (and also with hedonistic experiences
in general, like heavy partying, that the term 'rock 'n' roll is supposed to capture).

p. 7.

I don't actually think that we can maintain a distinction between aesthetic experiences on the one hand and sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll on
the other.  All things can be experienced in an aesthetic manner and some drug-induced experiences, for example, could very much count as aesthetic.

p. 7.

I will talk about four influential accounts of aesthetics, focusing on beauty, pleasure, emotion and 'valuing it for its own sake'....
I'm talking about them because each and every one of them contains some really important pointers to how we should and how we should ot think
about the domain of aesthetics.

p. 8.

### [1] Beauty?

The **most widely shared take on aesthetics** is that it's about beauty.  Just look around in the street - the word 'aesthetics' routinely shows up in
beauty salons....

I call this the 'beauty-salon approach'....  In fact, the main aim is to turn something not-so-beautiful into something more beautiful....

The beauty-salon approach solves the sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll problem with little effort.  Aesthetic experiences are experiences of
beautiful things.  Drug-induced experiences or sexual experiences, or the experience of rock 'n' roll, are not beautiful things.
So they don't count as aesthetic.

p. 8.  [**Emphasis added.**]

The point is that beauty is not a feature of objects that remains the same at all times, in all contexts, for all observers....
Even if beauty is not in the eye of the beholder - even if it is 'objective' in some sense, it is sensitive to what context we encounter
it in.  The beauty-salon approach can't explain this context-sensitivity.

p. 9.

### [2] Pleasure?

The general thought is that aesthetics is about pleasure.  The non-aesthetic is not.  Aesthetic experiences are (often - clearly not always)
pleasurable experiences - that's why we like having them....

Not all pleasure is aesthetic.

p. 11.

Aesthetic pleasure is typically sustaining pleasure.  You are looking at a painting, and the pleasure you feel motivates you to keep on looking
at it.  It is an open-ended activity just as walking along the [page break] beach is.  Our pleasure sustains our continued engagement with the
painting.  It is sometimes even difficult to tear ourselves away.

pp. 11-12.

Sustaining pleasure motivates and fine-tunes our ongoing aesthetic engagement by means of controlling our attention.

p. 13.

### [3] Emotions?

The **third** approach to delineating the aesthetic domain focuses on emotions.  The general thought is that aesthetic experiences are emotional
experiences.  So understanding what makes aesthetic experiences different from other kinds of experiences would be to nderstand what kind of
emotion is triggered here.

p. 14.  [**Emphasis added.**]

After all, much of contemporary art tries to stay as far away from our emotions as possible, preferring a merely intellectual or sometimes a
merely perceptual engagement (as in the case of conceptual art and op art).

p. 15.

One striking feature of aesthetic engagements is their diversity: our aesthetic experience of the Grand Canyon and of a Billie Holiday song
would involve very different emotions....

And even the same object can trigger very different emotions in different circumstances.  [**Context.**]

p. 15.

Nonetheless, it is undeniable that aesthetic engagement can be, and often is, an emotional affair.  Art can make you cry.  And nature too.
The link between aesthetics and emotions is something all aesthetic traditions, from Islamic and Sanskrit to Japanese and Chinese aesthetics,
talk about.

p. 16.

Conversely, is aesthetic engagement always emotional? ....  In at least some cases of aesthetic experience, it is the sensory that dominates,
not the emotional.  [**So, the answer is "no".**]

p. 16.

Emotion may not be what makes aesthetic experiences aesthetic.  But the emotion accounts of aesthetics are still important inasmuch as they
highlight just how emotions can be a crucial part of aesthetic experiences.  Any account of aesthetics needs to tell a story about how
emotional and aesthetic experiences can be, and often are, intertwined.

p. 17.

### [4] For its own sake?

Susan Sontag talks about aesthetic experience as detached.  Detached not just from emotions, but from indignation, approval, and also
practical considerations.  And this is the **last** popular candidate for keeping the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic apart: aesthetic
engagement is engagement for its own sake.  We don't do it in order to achieve some other, further goal.  We do it just for the aesthetic
kicks.

This proposal comes in many flavors....  If we can formulate the 'for its own sake' account without relying on the concept of valuing, we
really should try to do so.

p. 17.  [**Emphasis added.**]

These intermediate cases [e.g., reading a book for a class and enjoying it as well] show that 'doing it for its own sake' is not the holy
grail of aesthetics.

p. 18.

**Somethings you do for the trophy; some things for the process itself.  We need both.**
There are always goals, deadlines, promotion criteria.

p. 18.  [**Emphasis added.**]

Any account of aesthetic engagement needs to explain this important feature: that it is open-ended and a process, not a trophy activity.

p. 19.

[T]he **four** standard approaches to aesthetics still failed to give us a clear account of where exactly this [the aesthetic] domain starts
and where it ends

p. 20.  [**Emphasis added.**]

### [5] Attention?

I will argue that these accounts all point in the same direction, namely, that what is special about aesthetics is the way we exercise
[page break] our attention in aesthetic experiences.  This can help us explain how experiencing something as beautiful qualifies as
aesthetic and also what makes these experiences emotionally infused.  Attention was the missing piece in the pleasure-based accounts and
talking about the detached open-ended exercise of attention captures much of the 'for its own sake' accounts.  **As Marcel Prouse (1871-1922)
said, 'Attention can take various forms and the job of the artist is to invoke the most superior of these.'**

pp. 10-21.  [**Emphasis added.**]

## Chapter 3, Experience and attention - pp. 22-42

### Aesthetic attention

When we have an aesthetic experience, we don't just attend to the object we see.  We also attend to the quality of our experience.
Importantly, we attend to the relation between the two.

p. 38.

To use a very prosaic example, when we are looking at an apple, we can attend to the features of the apple.
Or we can attend to the features of our experience of the apple.  Or we can attend to both, and the relation between the two.
Attending this third way is what I take to be a crucial (and maybe close to universal) feature of aesthetic experience.

p. 39.

### Changing self, changing aesthetics

Take the example of a widely explored psychological phenomenon, the 'mere exposure effect'.
The more you are exposed to something, the more you tend to like it.  Just the mere exposure to something changes your preferences.
And this happens even if you are not aware of what you are exposed to.

p. 44.


## Chapter 4, Aesthetics and the self - pp. 43-55

### Experience versus judgement

Much of 'Western' aesthetics has been about well-informed aesthetic judgements.
Aesthetic judgements are statements (often to yourself, but sometimes also to others) that a particular object is beautiful or graceful or ugly or disgusting.
But the vast majority of our aesthetic engagement is nothing like this.
If it were, it would be difficult to explain why we care so much about all things aesthetic.
The reason why we watch a three-hour-long film or take a day-long huck in the mountains is not to come up with a well-informed aesthetic judgement about the
film or the landscape.  If we take the importance of aesthetics in our life seriously, we need to shift the emphasis away from aesthetic judgements to forms
of aesthetic engagement that are more enjoyable, more rewarding, and happen to us more often.

p. 46.

We spend so much time and money engaging with works of art not because we want to make aesthetic judgements about them.
We do it because the experience we have while engaging with works of art can be pleasurable, rewarding, and personally meaningful.
Not the judgement -- the experience.

p. 46.

## Chapter 5, Aesthetics and the other - pp. 56-71

### Aesthetics is not for policing

Nonetheless, and I can't stress this strongly enough, aesthetics is not a normative discipline.
Some parts of ethics might really be about normative claims (well, a branch of ethics is called 'normative ethics', so that would be a good candidatge).
But aesthetics is not.  Aesthetics is not primarily about what we should do.  It is about what we in fact do in what circumstances.

p. 59.

But we have seen that the beauty-salon approoach to aesthetics is not exactly an attractive view.
What makes an experience aesthetic is not that it is about a beautiful thing.  What makes it aesthetic is the way you exercise your attention.
And there is no accurate or inaccurate way of exercising your attention.
So while experiences may be accurate or illusory, what makes them aesthetic has nothing to do wiht their accuracy.
It has everything to do with the way attention is exercised.

p. 61.

Aesthetic disagreements matter, no doubt about that.  But sharing or failing to share aesthetic experiences matters much more.
And there are no right or wrong ways of having aesthetic experiences.

p. 62.

Lack of policing does not lead to anarchy.  If we are lucky, it leads to conversation, peaceful coexistence, and diversity.

p. 63.

It is not that a certain artwork just demands you to have a certain aesthetic reaction.
Rather, when you have an aesthetic reaction, you implicitly assume that everybody else has, or at least should have, the same reaction.
This is Immanuel Kant's view and it has had a lasting influence on 'Western' aesthetics.

[**I call it "projection".**]

I'm trying to say this politely and in awe of the intellectual achievement of Kant's philosophy, but this is one of the most arrogant ideas in
the history of aesthetics.  If you implicitly assume that everybody else should have the same reaction as you do, then you seriously under
appreciate the diversity of humankind and the diversity of the cultural backgrounds people come from.  **And any time we are even tempted to
think (or assume or feel) that whatever we do has universal appeal or universal communicability, that would be a good time to stop and exercise
what I call 'aesthetic humility' - thinking about just how contingent our own position and cultural background is compared to the vast diversity
of cultures on this planet.**

p. 63.  [**Emphasis added.**]

### Aesthetic disagreements in real life

The real question about aesthetic agreements and disagreements is not about who is right and who is wrong.  It is about the ways in which our
experiences depend on the allocation of our attention, our background beliefs and knowledge as well as our past [page break] exposure.
Knowing how these can alter our experience can help a lot in resolving aesthetic disagreements.

pp. 63-64.

The critic's job is to direct our attention to features we would not have noticed otherwise.
Attending to some of these features can completely transform our experience.

p. 65.

## Chapter 6, Aesthetics and life - pp. 72-85

[None]

## Chapter 7, Global aesthetics - pp. 86-106

### The geography of vision

Knowing what we know about how the mind works, **universalism is not an option.**  We can't assume that our engagement is the same as the engagement
intended and practised by the local producers and users of the artefact.

What we are attending to and how we do so very much depend on our background beliefs, knowledge, and perceptual skills, all of which are culturally
specific.  So our patterns of attention are also culturally specific.  But given that our experience of artefacts depends heavily on what we are
attending to, this means that there is significant cross-cultural variation in our experience of artefacts.

p. 88.  [**Emphasis added.**]

Change in (very culturally specific) attention leads to change in your experience of the artefact.

p. 89.

The second mediator [after cultural differences] of the top-down influences on our perceptual experience is **mental imagery.**  Our mental imagery
very much depends on what we know and believe and what other things we have perceived before....  And mental imagery plays an important role in our
experience of artworks (a recurreng theme in Japanese aesthetics).

p. 90.  [**Emphasis added.**]

### A global vocabulary

We know a lot about some centres [locations] of artefact production.  We know much less about others [e.g. in the past and in the 'New World'].
This introduces a significant asymmetry into thinking about global aesthetics....  **This should not lead us to think that artefacts in those parts
of the world that we know more about are somehow 'better' or more worthy of study.**
p. 91.  [**Emphasis added.**]

On a very abstract level, there are two different and distinctive modes of pictorial organization, which I call 'surface organization' and 'scene
organization'.  Every picture, regardless of where and when it was made, falls somewhere on the spectrum betwen surface organization and scene
organization.

Surface organization aims to draw attention to how the **two-dimensional**** outline shapes of the depicted objects are placed within the two-
dimensional frame.  Scene organization, in contrast, aims to draw attention to how the **three-dimensional** depicted objects are placed in the
depicted space.  There is a trade-off between the two and most pictures are trying to combine [page break] them.  But one - either scene or
surface organization - tends to win out when the two organizational principles are in conflict.

pp. 94-95.  [**Emphasis added.**]

The distinction between scene organization and surface organization is somewhat abstract.  So it would be helpful to substantiate this distinction
with the help of simpler features that are easier to spot.  I will focus on two such features: occlusion and empty surface.

In everyday perception, we get a lot of occlusion: we see some objects behind or in front of other objects.  The question is whether occlusion
shows up in pictures.  Surface organization implies that the picture maker pays attention to whether there is occlusion or not: occlusion in a
picture is a feature of how two-dimensional outline shapes of the depicted objects are related to each other on the two-dimensional surface.
Some pictures go out of their way to avoid occlusion.  Some others pile on occlusions.  Both are good indications of surface organization.
**And we can place all pictures on a spectrum between extreme lack of occlusion and extreme seeking out of occlusion.**

p. 95.  [**Emphasis added.**]

The second feature that every picture has is the presence or absence of empty surface.  In everyday perception, some of our visual field is
often empty in the sense that there are no preceptually interesting elements there - only the sky, the ground, [page break], an empty wall.
Some pictures deliberately try to avoid empty surface: they try to put pictorially interesting elements on every square inch of the surface.
Others deliberately seek out empty surfaces.

pp. 96-97.

We get a coordinate system on the basis of these two features: occlusion and empty surface.  And we can add other features like frame or
symmetry.  Some pictures respect or even emphasis their [page break] frame, others deliberately try to pretend that the frame is not there.
And as the frame is very much a two-dimensional surface feature, paying attention to it (either by emphasizing it or by de-emphasizing it)
is a sign of surface organization.

pp. 97-98.

### Aesthetic humility again

We should always be aware of the cultural perspective that we occumpy and treat our aesthetic evaluations with humility: as an evaluation
made from a very specific cultural perspective.  It is easy to be arrogant about aesthetics - maybe precisely because it matters so much
to us personally.  But this is all the more reason to be extra careful with our aesthetic evaluations.  **If there is one take-home message
of this book, it is that we all need more aesthetic humility.**  [And thus ends the book!]

p. 106.  [**Emphasis added.**]
