# Notes and Quotes From The War of Art

By Steven Pressfield, 2002.

## Book One - Resistance: Defining the Enemy, pp. 1-57

- "The enemy is a very good teacher." -- the Dalai Lama

p. 3.

### Resistance and Self-Medication

I once worked as a writer for a big New York ad agency.  Our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease.
Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure.

Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder.  These aren't diseases,
they're marketing ploys.  Doctors didn't discover them, copywriters did.

Depression and enxiety may be real.  But they can also be Resistance.

When we drug ourselves to blot out our soul's call, we are being good Americans and exemplary consumers.
We're doing exactly what TV commercials and pop materialist culture have been brainwashing us to do from birth.
Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard work, we simply consume a product.

Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.

p. 26.

### Resistance and Love

Resistance is directly proportional to love.  If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means
there's a tremendous amount of love there too.  If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't
feel anything.  **The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference.**
- p. 42.  [Emphasis added.]

## Book Two - Combating Resistance: Turning Pro, pp. 59-101

- "It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life." -- Telamon of Arcadia, mercenary of the fifth century B.C.

p. 61.

### A Professional Is Patient

The professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the stars time to align in his career, but to keep himself from
flaming out in each individual work.  **He knows that any job, whether it's a novel or a kitchen remodel, takes twice as long
as he thinks and costs twice as much.**  He accepts that.  he recognizes it as reality.

p. 75.  [Emphasis added.]

### A Professional Accepts No Excuses

The professional knows that Resistance is like a telemarketer; if you so much as say hello, you're finished.  The pro doesn't
even pick up the phone.  He stays at work.

p. 80.

### A Professional Self-Validates

The professional cannot allow the actions of others to define his reality.  Tomorrow morning the critic will be gone, but
the writer will still be there facing the blank page.  Nothing matters but that he keep working.  Short of family [page break]
crisis or the outbreak of World War II, the professional shows up, ready to serve the gods.

Remember, Resistance wants us to cede sovereignty to others.  It wants us to stake our self-worth, our identity, our
reason-for-being, on the response of others to our work.  Resistance knows we can't take this.  No one can.

**The professional blows critics off.**  He doesn't even hear them.  Critics, he reminds himself, are the unwitting mouthpieces
of Resistance and as such can be truly cunning and pernicious.  They can articulate in their reviews the same toxic venom that
Resistance itself concocts inside our heads.  That is their real evil.  Not that we believe them, but that we believe the
Resistance in our own minds, for which critics serve as unconscious spokespersons.

**The professional learns to recognize envy-drivien criticism and to take it for what it is: the supreme compliment.**
The critic hates most that which he would have done himself if he had had the guts.

pp. 92-93.  [Emphasis added.]

## Book Three - Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm, pp. 103-165

- "The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and pray them to grant you the thoughts, words, and deeds likely to render your
command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends, and your city the fullest measure of affection and glory
and advantage." -- Xenophon, The Cavalry Commander

p. 105.

### Invoking the Muse

The last thing I do before I sit down to work is say my prayer to the Muse.  I say it out loud, in absolute earnest.  Only then do I
get down to business.

p. 110.

In my little house I had no TV.  I never read a newspaper or went to a movie.  I just worked.  One afternoon I was banging away in the
little bedroom I had converted to an office, when I heard my neighbor's radio playing outside.  Someone in a loud voice was declaiming
". . . to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."  I came out.  What was going on?  "Didn't you hear?
Nixon's out; they got a new guy in there."

I had missed Watergate completely.

p. 111.

### Invoking the Muse, Part Two

Our ancestors were keenly cognizant of forces and energies whose seat was not in this material sphere but in a loftier, more mysterious one.
What did they believe about this higher reality?

First, they believed that death did not exist there.  The gods are immortal.

The gods, though not unlike humans, are infinitely more powerful.  To defy their will is futile.  To act toward heaven with pride is to call
down calamity.

Time and space display an altered existence in this higher dimension.  The gods travel "swift as thought."  They can tell the future, some of
them, and though the playwrite Agathon tells us,

- This alone is denied to God: the power to undo the past.

yet the immortals can play tricks with time, as we ourselves may sometimes, in dreams or visions.

p. 114.

The contemporary view is that all this is charming but preposterous.  Is it?  Then answer this.  Where did *Hamlet* come from?  Where did the
Parthenon come from?  Where did *Nude Descending a Staircase* come from?

p. 115.  [Emphasis in original.]

### Testament of a Visionary

- Eternity is in love with the creations of time. -- William Blake

p. 116.

What Blake means by "eternity," I think, is the sphere higher than this one, a plane of reality superior to the material dimension in which we
dwell.  In "eternity," there is no such thing as time (or Blake's syntax wouldn't distinguish it from "eternity") and probably no space either.
This plane may be inhabited by higher creatures.  Or it may be pure consciousness or spirit.  But whatever it is, according to Blake, it's
capable of being "in love."

If beings inhabit this plane, I take Blake to mean that they are incorporeal.  They don't have bodies.  But they have a connection to the
sphere of time, the one we live in.  These gods or spirits participate in this dimension.  They take an interest in it.

"Eternity is in love with the creations of time" means, to me, that in some way these creatures of the higher sphere (or [page break] the
sphere itself, in the abstract) take joy in what we time-bound beings can bring forth into physical existence in our limited material sphere.

It may be pushing the envelope, but if these beings take joy in the "creations of time," might they not also nudge us a little to produce them?
If that's true, then the image of the Muse whispering inspiration in the artist's ear is quite apt.

The timeless communicating to the timebound.

By Blake's model, as I understand it, it's as though the Fifth Symphony existed already in that higher sphere, before Beethoven sat down and
played dah-dah-dah-DUM.  The catch was this: The work existed only as potential -- without a body, so to speak.  It wasn't music yet.  You
couldn't play it.  You couldn't hear it.

It needed someone.  It needed a corporeal being, a human, an artist (or more precisely a *genius,* in the Latin sense of "soul" or "animating
spirit") to bring it into being on this material plane.  So the Muse whispered in Beethoven's ear.  Maybe she hummed a few bars into a million
other ears.  But no one else heard her.  Only Beethoven got it.

He brought it forth.  He made the Fifth Symphony a "creation of time," which "eternity" could be "in love with."

pp. 116-117.  [Emphasis in original.]

### Invoking the Muse, Part Three

Artists have invoked the Muse since time immemorial.  There is great wisdom to this.  There is magic to effacing our human arrogance and humbly
entreating help from a source we cannot see, hear, touch, or smell.  Here's the start of Homer's *Odyssey," the T. E. Lawrence translation:

- O Divine Poesy, goddess, daughter of Zeus, sustain for me this song of the various-minded man who, after he had plundered the
innermost citadel of hallowed Troy, was made to stray grievously about the coasts of men, the sport of their customs, good and
bad, while his heart, through all the sea-faring, ached with an agony to redeem himself and bring his company safe home.  Vain
hope -- for them.  The fools!  Their own witlessness cast them aside.  To destroy for meat the oxen of the most exalted Sun,
wherefore the Sun-god blotted out the day of their return.  Make this tale live for us in all its many bearings, O Muse. . . .

This passage will reward closer study.

p. 119.

### The Magic of Keeping Going

When I finish a day's work, I head up into the hills for a hike.  I take a pocket tape recorder because I know that as my
surface mind empties with the walk, another part of me will chime in and start talking.

- The word "leer" on page 342 . . . it should be "ogle."
- You repeated yourself in Chapter 21.  The last sentence is just like that one in the middle of Chapter 7.

p. 125.

### Life and Death

The moment a person learns he's got terminal cancer, a profound shift takes place in his psyche.  At one stroke in the doctor's
office he becomes aware of what really matters to him.  Things that sixty seconds earlier had seemed all-important suddenly
appear meaningless, while people and concerns that he had till then dismissed at once take on supreme importance.

Maybe, he realizes, working this weekend on that big deal at the office isn't all that vital.  Maybe it's more important to fly
cross-country for his grandson's graduation.  Maybe it isn't so crucial that he have the last word in the fight with his wife.
Maybe instead he should tell her how much she means to him and how deeply he has always loved her.

p. 132.

The Ego, Jung tells us, is that part of the psyche that we think of as "I."  Our conscious intelligence.  Our everyday brain
that thinks, plans, and runs the show of our day-to-day life.

The Self, as Jung defined it, is a greater entity, which includes the Ego but also incorporates the Personal and Collective
Unconscious.  Dreams and intuitions come from the Self.  The archetypes of the unconscious dwell there.  It is, Jung believed,
the sphere of the soul.

What happens in that instant when we learn we may soon die, Tom Laughlin contends, is that the seat of our consciousness shifts.

It moves from the Ego to the Self.

p. 134.

### The Ego and the Self

Here's what I think.  I think angels make their home in the Self, while Resistance has its seat in the Ego.

The fight is between the two.

p. 136.

The Ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material existence....

Here's what the Ego believes:

1. *Death is real.*  ....
2. *Time and space are real.*  ....  [page break]
3. *Every individual is different and separate from every other.*  ....
4. *The predominant impulse of life is self-preservation.*  ....
5. *There is no God.*  ....

These are the principles the Ego lives by.  They are sound solid principles.

1. *Death is an illusion.*  ....
2. *Time and space are illusions.*  ....  [page break]
3. *All beings are one.*  If I hurt you, I hurt myself.
4. *The supreme emotion is love.*  ....
5. *God is all there is.*  Everything that is, is God in one form or another.  God, the divine ground, is that in which we live
and move and have our being.  Infinite planes of reality exist, all created by, sustained by and infused by the spirit of God.

pp. 136-138.

### Experiencing the Self

Have you ever wondered why the slang terms for intoxication are so demolition-oriented?  Stoned, smashed, hammered.  It's
because they're talking about the Ego.  It's the Ego that gets blasted, wasted, plastered.  We demolish the Ego to get to the Self.

p. 139.

Dreams come from the Self.  Ideas come from the Self.  When we meditate we access the Self.  When we fast, when we pray, when we
go on a vision quest, it's the Self we're seeking.  When the dervish whirls, when the yogi chants, when the sadhu mutiliates his
flesh; when penitents crawl a hundred miles on their knees, when Native Americans pierce themselves in the Sun Dance, when suburban
kids take Ecstasy and dance all night at a rave, they're seeking the Self.  When we deliberately alter our consciousness in any way,
we're trying to find the Self.  When the alcholic collapses in the gutter, that voice that tells him, "I'll save you," comes from
the Self.

The Self is our deepest being.

p. 139.

The Self speaks for the future.

That's why the Ego hates it.

p. 140.

The Ego hates artists because they are the pathfinders and bearers of the future, because each one dares, in James Joyce's phrase,
to "forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race."

p. 141.

### Fear

Resistance feeds on fear.  We experience Resistance as fear.

p. .

### Territory versus Hierarchy

In the animal kingdom, individuals define themselves in one of two ways -- by their rank within a hierarchy (a hen in a pecking
order, a wolf in a pack) or by their connection to a territory (a home base, a hunting ground, a turf).

This is  how individuals -- human as well as animals -- achieve psychological security.  They know where they stand.  The world
makes sense.

Of the two orientations, the hierarchical seems to be the default setting.

p. 147.

### The Artist and the Hierarchy

For the artist to define himself hierarchically is fatal.

p. 150.

But the artist cannot look to others to validate his efforts [page break] or his calling.  If you don't believe me, ask Van Gogh,
who produced masterpiece after masterpiece and never found a buyer in his whole life.

The artist must operate territorially.  He must do his work for its own sake.

To labor in the arts for any reason other than love is prostitution.  Recall the fate of Odysseus' men who slew the cattle of the sun.

- Their own witlessness cast them away.
- The fools!  To destroy for meat the oxen
- of the most exalted Sun, wherefore the sun-god
- blotted out the day of their return.

In the hierarchy, the artist faces outward.  Meeting someone new he asks himself, What can this person do for me?  How can this person
advance my standing?

In the hierarchy, the artist looks up and looks down.  The one place he can't look is that place he must: within.

pp. 150-151.

### The Definition of a Hack

The hack condescends to his audience.  He thinks he's superior to them.  The truth is, he's scared to death of them or, more accurately,
scared of being authentic in front of them, scared of writing what he really feels or believes, what he himself thinks is interesting.
He's afraid it won't sell.  So he tries to anticipate what the market (a telling word) wants, then gives it to them.

In other words, the hack writes hierarchically.  He writes what he imagines will play well in the eyes of others.  He does not ask
himself, What do I myself want to write?  What do I think is important?  Instead he asks, What's hot, what can I make a deal for?

The hack is like the politician who consults the polls before he takes a position.  He's a demagogue.  He panders.

It can pay off, being a hack.  Given the depraved state of American culture, a slick dude can make millions being a hack.  But even if
you succeed, you lose, because you've [page break] sold out your Muse, and your Muse is you, the best part of yourself, where your finest
and only true work comes from.

I was starving as a screenwriter when the idea for *The Legend of Bagger Vance* came to me.  It came as a book, not a movie.  I met with
my agent and gave him the bad news.  We both knew that first novels take forever and sell for nothing.  Worse, a novel about golf, even if
we could find a publisher, is a strait shot to the remainder bin.

But the Muse had me.  I had to do it.  To my amazement, the book succeeded critally and commercially better than anything I'd ever done,
and others since have been lucky too.  Why?  My best guess is this: I trusted what I wanted, not what I thought woule work.  I did what I
myself thought was interesting, and left its reception to the gods.

The artist can't do his work hierarchically.  He has to work territorially.

pp. 152-153.  [Emphasis in original.]

### The Fruits of Our Labor.

We must do our work for our own sake, not for fortune or applause.

Then there's the third way proffered by the Lord of Discipline, which is beyond both hierarchy and territory.  That is to do the work
and give it to Him.  Do it as an offering to God.

- Give the act to me.
- Purged of hope and ego,
- Fix your attention on the soul.
- Act and do for me.

The work comes from heaven anyway.  Why not give it back?

To labor in this way, *The Bhagavad-Gita* tells us, is a form of meditation and a supreme species of spiritual devotion.  It also, I
believe, conforms most closely to Higher Reality.  In fact, we are servants of the Mystery.  We were put here on [page break] earth to
act as agents of the Infinite, to bring into existence that which is not yet, but which will be, through us.

. . . .  To acknowledge that reality, to efface all ego, to let the work come through us and give it back freely to its source, that,
in my opinion, is as true to reality as it gets.

pp. 161-162.  [Emphasis in original.]
