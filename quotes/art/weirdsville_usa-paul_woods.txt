[1/2] Here are some quotes from Chapter 4, "Dune: Detours to Other Worlds," in the book "Weirdsville USA: The Obsessive Universe of David Lynch," by Paul A. Woods [1997, 2000].
"[In 1980] Lynch was more enthusiastic about the overtures received from Dino De Laurentiis on Dune than anything else on offer - including, perversely enough, the third of the Star Wars films, whose writer/producer, George Lucas, somehow shared the belief that Lynch - as a director of 'weird stuff' [Eraserhead and Elephant Man] - would be a natural for science fiction." [p. 57]
"So finely detailed was [author Frank] Herbert's epic vision ... it seemed to all but the most blindly ambitious film-maker, Dune was clearly unfilmable." [p. 58]
"With $2 million of American backers' money already sunk into pre-production, with no visible end in sight, Dune [under the original director Alejandro Jodorowsky] was already way over-budget before the first day of shooting had begun and, at the end of 1975, production stalled completely." [p. 59]
"Ridley Scott was announced as director in October 1979, his production of Alien topping the box office on both sides of the Atlantic." [p. 60]
"Scott's conception was regarded as 'too high-tech', according to Rafaella de Laurentiis....  Scott abandoned the project and would go on to direct Blade Runner (1982).
"Dino had now handed over the daily production chores to Rafaella....
"The director she had in mind was David Lynch." [ p. 60]
"The clapperboard on the first cut was held by Frank Herbert himself." [p. 61]
"The special effects team ran as a who's who of early '80s Hollywood technocrats:"  [p. 63]
"[A] young actor fresh to the screen, Kyle MacLaughlin was Lynch's own choice for the role of Paul Atreides....  'I first discovered Dune when I was 14, and I've read it once a year ever since,' enthused MacLachlan."  [p. 63]
"Sting's appearance in the film is testament to Lynch's hip appeal filtering through to the mainstream rock industry 'I'm only doing this film because of David,' the singer claimed, as if pre-empting the attack; 'he's a madman in sheep's clothing.' " [p. 64]
" 'Dune was such an unbelievable project,' [star of Eraserhead Jack] Nance would later recall....  'You know, 2,500 people in costume on this thing.' " [p. 65]
"Almost endearingly, the De Laurentiises initially had so much faith in their super-budget production that they optioned all five of Herbert's Dune novels....  The minds of Lynch admirers may boggle to reflect that somewhere, on an alternative world in a parallel universe, David Lynch is squandering the rest of his career by making sequels to Dune." [p. 65]
"Dune, the end product, is a film which seems strangely half-finished but, at the same time, overdone." [p. 65]
" 'In some ways I know I've had to hold back,' Lynch fatally admitted, part-way through shooting.  'For one thing the film has got to be PG....  You can think of strange things to do, but as soon as they throw in PG, a lot of them go out the window.' " [p.66]
"In the end, despite the many elements which went into making the film ... the only thing Due would ever be noted for was its special effects." [p.68]
"Reassuring for Lynch - at least temporarily - was the positive reaction of Frank Herbert and the rest of the preview audience.  'My God, we've got it!' Herbert cried out loud at the screening." [p. 68]
"When the film eventually opened in early December 1984, it was the most eagerly awaited science fiction film yet put into production." [p.68]
"Outside of the genre fan market, things were a little different....  Reviews which unfairly savaged Dune, or failed to acknowledge its visual inventiveness, were rare - but neither did it elicit a passionate love-ot-or-hate-it response.  Instead, there was bemusement.  And most of all, universal indifference.
"As for Lynch fans, their general disappointment can be summed up in a comment from that first review: 'the enormity of the production pretty well crushes his artistic distinctiveness'." [p. 69]
" 'I sold out on Dune,' he [Lynch] admitted of the project which damn near sank him.  'I was making it for the producers, not for myself.  That's why the right of final cut is crucial.  One person has to be the filter for everything.' " [p. 70]
" 'I think that Dune was probably the first and last time that much money will be spent on a project around or by David,' Jennifer Lynch would later opine, having kept a close eye on her father's career as she grew up.  'After Dune was released, and the cut was what it was, and he'll probably tell you this too, he died a thousand deaths.  A *thousand* deaths, again and again and again.'
" 'I was, you know, beaten down badly after Dune,' concurred Lynch, 'and in my mind I had nowhere further to fall.' " [p. 70]
"He decided that he yearned to set a film in the decade of his birth, the 1940s - 'a dark sort of film *noir* kind of thing' - or, even more nostalgic, the 1950s, the formative era when he grew to adolescence, full of stuff 'just like my woodpeckers and bobby socks and wild fins and plastic'....  'So I'm looking for stories or a script in the '50s, you know, detectives and that kind of thing - diner stuff.'
"He could look, but he wouldn't find - unless he took the same route back to the worlds he wished to visit that he'd take in order to arrive.  If David Lynch wanted to work in some mythical 1950s world, he'd have to create it for himself." [p. 71]

FYI Chapter 5 of Wood's book is entitled "Blue Velvet: America's Dark Underbelly."
