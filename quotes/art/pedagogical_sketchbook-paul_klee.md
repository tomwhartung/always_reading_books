# Notes and Quotes From Pedagogical Sketchbook

By Paul Klee, Introduction and Translation by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, 1925, first published in England in 1953.

## Active, Medial, and Passive Lines

To really understand this, I will have to buy the book so I can see the Figures.

### I.2

- An active line, limited in its movement by fixed points (Fig. 6):

p. 18.

### I.3

- A medial line which is both: point progression and planar effect (Fig 7):

p. 18.

### I.4

- Passive lines which are the result of an activation of planes (line progression) (Fig. 8):

p. 19.

## Dimensions

Pages 35-41 have some nice ideas about giving images a sense of depth.

- Two dimensions versus Three dimensions
- Verticality versus Horizontality

## Equilibrium!?!?

Pages 42-45 have some nice ideas about how to achieve balance without symmetry.
