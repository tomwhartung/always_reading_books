Quotes from Cezanne Portraits by John Elderfield with Mary Morton and Xavier Rey, 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The English painter-critic Walter Sickert, writing in 1910, more carefully divided portraits into two kinds: "pictures painted
by artists as servants of their customers" and" pictures painted by artists who are masters of their customers."  But aspiring
French painters of the 1860s and 1870s, Cezanne included, had long mastered a third kind: pictures not paintef for customers,
but rather of people the knew.
An additional reason why portraiture needed to be redefined came as the result of an invention.  The enormous popularity of
photographic portraits, especially of small, informal *cartes-de-visite,* did not compromise the viability of portrait painting --
a common claim -- but did offer what historian Carol Armstrong nicely calls a "boldly strange" alternative to the painted portrait
that caught the attention of many critics and artists, such as Cezanne; and worried others.  The example of photography, a young,
mechanical, reproductive medium opposed to but influencing the old, personalized, imaginative one, expanded the question of
depersonalised representation, attaching it to concerns about modern alienation and loss of identity in an age of mass production.
Cezanne, although attracted to photography and himself accused of depersonalisation, was traditional in his views of the world and
highly suspicious of modernisation, famously complaining about the introduction of electric street lighting in Marseille because it
spoiled the twilight.

Rilke admired this work even more than the self-portrait; and, in the letter that he wrote about it, he made a tiny drawing of the
wallpaper pattern in the background - "a cross with the centre left out," he called it.  This motif quietly [page break] implies a
gridded substructure, a multicoloured pattern -- half billowing tapestry, half jigsaw -- of bands, blocks and curved pieces of
varying sizes.  The consistency of the composition lies in part in that settled order; and in part in the density of the pictorial
surface, the method of its building revealed in the less finished lower-right corner.  Within this spendour Hortense sits, cool and
composed.  There is nothing quite like this in the previous history of portraiture.

The depiction of emotions and expressions had been a topic of great interest among French artists since the seventeenth century,
first gaining currency in Charles Le Brun's phost humously published *Conferences sur l'expression* of 1698, and in appreciation of
the expressive heads of Cezanne's admired Nicholas Poussin, which may have been in his mind as he set about painting his own.  Moreover,
the term *tete d'expression,* describing portraits depicting emotion and the subject of a national competition established in the late
eighteenth century, remained in currency.
