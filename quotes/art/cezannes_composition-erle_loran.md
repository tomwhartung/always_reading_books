Notes and Quotes from *Cezanne's Composition, Analysis of His Form With Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs,* by Erle Loran, 1943.

**Note:** This book really helped me understand how Cezanne inspired the Cubists!  In particular:

* Finally, a definition of *the plastic means!*
* The photographs of his motifs -- especially those of The Sainte Victoire mountain -- juxtaposed with his paintings

These revelations led to multiple real "Ah-ha" moments!

THE FUNCTION OF LINE AND MODULATING.  In John Rewald's book, in a chapter entitled "Theories artistiques de Cezanne," the author
quotes from Balzac's novel, *Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu,* a passing in which, as he says, the hero, Frenhofer, expounds a theory of
drawing that is surprisingly close to the meaning of the quotations I have cited from Cezanne.  It is well established that Cezanne
felt a deep emotional identification with Frenhofer.  It is my opinion that Cezanne's contradictory opinions in some measure owe
their origin to this identification.
Frenhofer explains: "I have not dryly traced out the outer contours of my figure and made every little anatomical detail stand out,
because the human body doesn't end in lines....  [Ellipsis in original.]  Strictly speaking, drawing does not [page break] exist ...
[ellipsis in original] line is the means by which man gets a clear idea about the effect of light on objects; but there is no line
in nature, there everything is full: it is in modeling that one draws, that is to say that one detaches things from their surroundings,
the distribution of light alone is what gives the true semblance of things! ...  [Ellipsis in original.]  Perhaps one should not draw a
single feature; it might be better to approach a figure at the center, beginning first at the protuberances nearest the light, passing
on to the more shaded parts.  Doesn't the sun proceed in this way, that divine painter of the universe?"
Regardless of the many statements Cezanne has made that are similar to the theories expounded by Balzac's character, his actual procedure
in painting was quite different.  For example, instead of beginning at the highlights of forms, Cezanne began with the dark at the outer
contours.  He modulated gragually toward the light, painting with chromatic gradations.  We know this because, in a typical unfinished
painting, the protruding part of the volumes is often left entirely unpainted (Plate XXXVIII).  Almost all the water colors tell the same
story.

## Section III. An Illustrated Glossary, pp. 17-24.

### Section III, Part One

THE PICTURE PLANE, or the area upon which the artist draws and paints, is a flat surface having only two dimensions, marked 1 and 2 in the
illustration.  The two-dimensional character of the picture plane will be taken as the primary law or premise of picture making in the art
of Cezanne as well as in that of other masters of classical space.
....  In Cezanne's painting there are decorative qualities and other space- and volume-controlling factors that afford the ultimate two-
dimensional balance.
- p. 17.
---------

THE PICTURE FORMAT .... may be rectangular, square, circular, triangular, and so on.  *A well-organized picture must be a self-sufficient
and closed unit within a specific frame or format.*
- p. 17.  Emphasis in original as *italics.*
---------

NEGATIVE SPACE is the three-dimensional depth, the volume of air or empty space, within which the solid or *positive* volumes of a picture
are organized.
- p. 17.  Emphasis in original as *italics.*
---------

When the realistic deep space of a subject in nature, as illustrated in the diagram, [page break] is re-created by the artist and made to
function architecturally, plastically, in relation to the picture plane, the space becomes *pictorial space.*  It is then no longer
sculputurally imitative or realistic space.
Terms used in referring to the negative space are: three-dimensionality, deep space, total space, "picture box," stage space, recession
into space, spatial movement, and three-dimensional movement.
- pp. 17-18.  Emphasis in original as *italics.*
---------

[**A Key Idea,** found at the end of the longer quote immediately below:]

Thus line, plane, volume, color, texture, and so on, are the plastic means used to build and organize the total space in the picture plane.
Hence plastic qualities are not only three-dimensional, but two-dimensional as well.
- p. 18.
---------

[**Context** for the **Key Idea** Above:]

THE PLASTIC MEANS or PLASTIC FORM are terms used often in the present study, and are given a connotation different from that made
familiar in art criticism and art history in general.  The traditional connotation implies sculptural roundness as achieved through
light-and-shade modeling and chiaroscuro.  In this book the term *sculptural effect* is used when roundness is implied.  On the contrary,
the term *plastic means* connotes three-dimensional space in general.  Diagram II is indended as a compendium of the plastic field for
Cezanne's picture shown in Plate VII.  All the diagrams in the Glossary deal with various aspects of the plastic means.  The sum of all
the diagrams for Plates I and X constitute the analysis of the plastic means that Cezanne has used in creating these paintings.  Thus
line, plane, volume, color, texture, and so on, are the plastic means used to build and organize the total space in the picture plane.
Hence plastic qualities are not only three-dimensional, but two-dimensional as well.
- p. 18.  Emphasis in original as italics.
---------

[**A Key Idea,** found near the end, and at the end, of the longer quote immediately below:]

The correlation of two-dimensional factors of design and flat pattern with three-dimensional elements of volume and space, the relation
between color and form -- these are the purely plastic factors upon which the art of Cezanne was founded....  *Plastic qualities,* as
here referred to, *signify the total sum of the elements involved in a formally planned relationship between color and form.*
- p. 18.
---------

[**Context** for the **Key Idea** Above:]

NEGATIVE SHAPES.  In the two-dimensional sense, with no regard for three-dimensional depth, the terms negative shape, negative pattern,
and negative space are often used.  Areas such as those marked N in Diagram III could be cut out of a flat piece of paper....  The object
against a negative background, the *positive* volume of an apple against the negative table top, the positive volumes of trees against a
negative sky, are examples of positive and negative areas, patterns, shapes.  Diagram IV of Plate X describes positive and negative shapes
in this sense.  Most discussions of composition are concerned only with such flat design.  The more mysterious, purely illusory element of
deep space, or three-dimensionality, illustrated in Diagram II, where positive volumes are located in the negative space of the "picture
box," is of primary importance in the understanding of Cezanne, and most of the diagrammatic analyses and photographs of Cezanne's motifs
in this book are concerned with it.  The correlation of two-dimensional factors of design and flat pattern with three-dimensional elements
of volume and space, the relation between color and form -- these are the purely plastic factors upon which the art of Cezanne was founded.
The plastic qualities in Cezanne should not be confused with sculptural solidity.  Throughout this study the term sculptural effect is used
when the latter quality [i.e., "sculptural solidity"] is described.  *Plastic qualities,* as here referred to, *signify the total sum of
the elements involved in a formally planned relationship between color and form.*

### Section III, Part Two

[**Note:** this section contains many illustrations of basic compositions, e.g., Static Plane, Dynamic Plane, Overlapping Planes, etc.,
that I might want to copy someday.]

LIGHT AND DARK PATTERNS (CLOSED).  Diagram XVIII is a combination of light and dark patterns all of which remain *closed within their
separate compartments.*  Cezanne's still lifes may often be described as closed or *compartmental* in their color shapes; but more often,
and particularly in his landscapes, his color and light-dark patterns tend to be *open.*
OPEN-COLOR PATTERN.  Diagram XIX is an illustration of open patterns of light and dark.  In painting, the system is called open color.
When the patterns of light and dark (or color) are arbitrary and not confined to definitel forms, it is necessary to superimpose a line
drawing in order to establish volume and space.  Cezanne's painting abounds in examples of free and open color with superimposed line,
but his followers, notably Dufy, have made a definite method or system out of the idea.

## Section IV. How Cezanne Organized a Picture, pp. 25-33.

LINE DRAWING.  An outline of the characteristic elements of Cezanne's form, his approach to the actual painting of a picture, will serve
as an introduction to the diagrams and photographs of motifs.  First of all, he started to work on a bare canvas with a pencil or charcoal.
Regardless of how briefly he sketched in the main contours, he was *using line to establish the planes* which filled the space.  Almost
every water color, every unfinished oil painting, makes this procedure unmistakable.  See Plates II, III, XXII, XXIV, XXXIII, XXXVIII.
(Only his mature work is under consideration here.)
The next step was to retrace and verify these drawn lines with a bluish gray color, thinly applied.  The line, although somewhat segmented,
was line drawing in a clear sense of the word (there was no avoidance of line or starting with mere spots of color).
- p. 25.  Emphasis in original as italics.
---------

COLOR MODULATION.  Once the colored outline had established the space relationships with adequate firmness, the process of distributing the
small planes of color began.  A careful examination of the unfinished paintings confirms the observation of Emile Bernard that he began
with the dark side, at the outer contours of the volumes, using at first only cool neutral colors.  He distributed these cool planes,
usually in small patches, throughout the picture, without stopping to finish any single part or object in its entirety....  Cezanne did,
as he said, "advance all of my canvas at one time."
- p. 25.
---------

THE LINE REMAINS FIRM.  During the process of building up the color relations, Cezanne was constantly reestablishing the countours.  "The
more the color harmonizes, the more the drawing becomes precise" -- not automatically, but by superimposing a firm line around those parts
of a volume which might become weak through overpainting.
- p. 26.
---------

LOST AND FOUND EDGES.  Cezanne rarely drew a completely continuous line around his planes.  At certain points the line would be lost,
allowing the volume to fuse, or "pass" into the negative space or background.
- p. 26.
---------

[**A Key Idea,** found at the end of the longer quote immediately below:]

If Cezanne maintains a high place in the history of painting, it may well be because of his mastery over these basic structural planes
and their synthesis with his rich and functional color.
- p. 27.
---------

[**Context** for the **Key Idea** Above:]

PLANES.  The control of planes is the essence of Cezanne's achievement.  I am not so much impressed with the tiny planes that are kept
distinct and unblended in the familiar chromatic passages or color modulations.  It is the organization of the important underlying
planes -- their rotation from static to dynamic positions, the tensions, the space intervals between them, their movement into depth
and their inevitable return to the picture plane -- that is primarily importrant; it is with the plane manipulations that many of the
photographic comparisons and diagrams are concerned.  If Cezanne maintains a high place in the history of painting, it may well be because
of his mastery over these basic structural planes and their synthesis with his rich and functional color.
- p. 27.
---------

VOLUMES.  With lines the artist creates planes; with planes he creates volumes....  The accompanying photographs of motifs reveal how
much he sometimes flattened out the volumes in order to achieve integration and balance on the picture plane.  The control of negative
space, the tension between the volumes, was a consideration equal in importance to the creation of solidity in the volumes themselves.
- p. 27.
---------

COLOR.  Cezanne's importance cannot rest on his color alone, for he did not establish the form and space relations solely with color.
- p. 27.
---------

The color, when well organized, forms a closed unit.  If two areas of red in one corner of a picture are the true local color of certain
objects, similar hues of red must be introduced in other parts of the picture, whether other objects in the motif are red or not.  There
should be a complete balance and tension between the red shapes.
- p. 28.
---------

Color balance throughout the entire picture area was the final aim.
- p. 28.
---------

My argument is that Cezanne achieved *light* in the sense that modern painters give to the word, namely, the creation of an inner light
that emanates from the color relations in the picture itself, without regard for the mere copying of realistic effects of light and shade.
Cezanne, therefore, pointed the way to the freedom and release that the modern artist has regained -- the release from servile imitation
of light and shade.
- p. 29.  Emphasis in original as italics.
---------

DISTORTION.  Distortion is one of the important ingredients of form in the art of Cezanne.  In the present study, a special section of
diagrams is given over to peculiarities of the drawing of plates and other objects used as subject matter in studio pictures (Plates XIV
and XVIII).
- p. 29.
---------

BRUSH STROKES; HANDLING.  The "handwriting" or brush marks of an artist are often referred to as his technique.
- p. 30.
---------

TEXTURES.  In Cezanne there is no actual concern with textures, in the modern understanding of the term....  The textural life in a painting
by Cezanne is simply the result of his method of creating color and form.
- p. 31.
---------

SPACE ORGANIZATION.  Cezanne's comment that "nature is more in depth than in the surface" suggests that his major concern was with the
spatial elements rather than with decorative pattern.
- p. 31.
---------

CONCLUSION.  Included in this broader consideration of all the components of pictorial space is the more elementary and easily understood
requirement of making the individual volumes appear solid....  Complete control of pictorial space, as Cezanne achieved it in his greatest
work, involves, first, the creation of space illusions through the overlapping of planes.  By varying the distance (the space intervals)
between these planes, rhythmic tensions are developed.  But *all these forces are bound within the picture format, and they find ultimate
balance or equilibrium in relation to the picture plane.

[Remarks relating to Plate VII, The Jas de Bouffan.]

The photographs of the motif, showing the buildings to be those of the Jas De Bouffan, the Cézanne family's country estate, explain the origin
of the formal relations, but they give no indication of the dramatic and emotional force that Cézanne's painting expresses.  This painting has
always suggested to me the setting for a melodramatic scene in a Dostoievski novel, and whe I first went to Aix I was particularly interested
to discover the actual motif....  The photographs shown here make the disappointing and prosaic truth clear enough.
The most obvious distortion is the dynamic tipping of the house on the left.  The dramatic quality of the picture derives principally from this
strong leftward movement of the axis of the house, but the window shapes, giving a somewhat haunted or deserted aspect to the scene, also
contribute to the dramatic effect.  The leftward-leaning axis of the house may be understood as a distortion that increases the tension of the
house in relation to the four sides of the frame as well as in relation to the planes marked A and C.
- p. 53.
---------

The spectator's eye follows this movement [from the foreground to the house in the background on the left side of the painting] and is turned
upward by the parallel plane of the house.  The eye is easily drawn upward by the strong vertical lines of windows, drainpipes, and chimneys;
but the leftward tipping of the axis of the house must be recognized as the principal magnetic force, pulling they eye into space toward the
upper left and up to the house roof.
- p. 53.
---------

To the person who is only able to react to the illustrative or story-telling drama of the painting this long and detailed analysis may seem a
cold denial of feeling.  The intention has been to show that the real drama in the painting derives from the plastic forces, without questioning
the great importance of emotional and psychological associations with subject and locale.  Cézanne consistently expresses the spirit of the
subject, but the mysterious Dostoievskian quality, mentioned previously, depends far more on plastic, organizational devices than on iconographic
or literary means.  Incidentally, there has been no mention of color modulations in the examination of this picture.  All the structural problems
analyzed depend on the use of line and plane, the planes being more nearly flat than in most pictures by Cézanne.
