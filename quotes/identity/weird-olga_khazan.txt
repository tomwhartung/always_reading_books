Notes and quotes from Weird, The Power of Being an Outsider in an Insider World, by Olga Khazan, 2020.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 1 - Weird, pp. 3-22.
A boy called me a "wetback" in the middle of class, and I thought seriously about changing my name.  When
we watcged the *Addams Family* movies, I developed a strong kinship with pale, dour, Wednesday Addams.
- p. 4 [Emphasis in original as italics].

And *most* Americans report feeling lonely and misunderstood.  In a 2018 survey of 20,000 American adults,
54 percent of the respondents said that they "always or sometimes feel that no one knows them well," and
47 percent sometimes or always feel "left out."  "Most Americans," the report concluded, "are considered lonely."
- p. 15 [Emphasis in original as italics].

Either way, my weirdness was the defining experience of my life.  Both my pathologies and strengths flow from it.
- p. 19.

Here is the conclusion I cam to: It's good to be a weirdo.  Being different from other people around you confers
hidden advantages that can help you in life and in work.
- p. 20.

Chapter 2 - The Realization, pp. 23-67.
Because of this tendency for people to cluster with others like them, it is more difficult to find acceptance and
friendship in an environment where you're the different one.  No one, unfortunately, sees themselves in you.
- p. 42.

Tight cultures are those in which social norms [page break] are strict and formal, and the punishments for breaking
them are severe.  In tight cultures, people are more in step with one another, but loose cultures permit a wider range
of behaviors.  Tight cultures are the military, the Amish, or Singapore, where a nineteen-year-old American named
Michael Fay was caned in 1994 for vandalism.  Meanwhile, tech cultures are loose, as is the Netherlands, where parents
and tachers allow little kids to play "doctor" with one another in the spirit of positive bodily exploration.  It's
easier to be weird in a loose culture than in a tight one.
- pp. 52-53.

Essentially, cultures trade orderliness for creativity as they go from tighter to looser.
- p. 53.
