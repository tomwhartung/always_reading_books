Notes and quotes from Weird, The Power of Being an Outsider in an Insider World, by Olga Khazan, 2020.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART ONE: BEING WEIRD
Chapter 1 - Weird, pp. 3-22.
A boy called me a "wetback" in the middle of class, and I thought seriously about changing my name.  When
we watcged the *Addams Family* movies, I developed a strong kinship with pale, dour, Wednesday Addams.
- p. 4. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

And *most* Americans report feeling lonely and misunderstood.  In a 2018 survey of 20,000 American adults,
54 percent of the respondents said that they "always or sometimes feel that no one knows them well," and
47 percent sometimes or always feel "left out."  "Most Americans," the report concluded, "are considered lonely."
- p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Either way, my weirdness was the defining experience of my life.  Both my pathologies and strengths flow from it.
- p. 19.

Here is the conclusion I cam to: It's good to be a weirdo.  Being different from other people around you confers
hidden advantages that can help you in life and in work.
- p. 20.

Chapter 2 - The Realization, pp. 23-67.
Because of this tendency for people to cluster with others like them, it is more difficult to find acceptance and
friendship in an environment where you're the different one.  No one, unfortunately, sees themselves in you.
- p. 42.

Tight cultures are those in which social norms [page break] are strict and formal, and the punishments for breaking
them are severe.  In tight cultures, people are more in step with one another, but loose cultures permit a wider range
of behaviors.  Tight cultures are the military, the Amish, or Singapore, where a nineteen-year-old American named
Michael Fay was caned in 1994 for vandalism.  Meanwhile, tech cultures are loose, as is the Netherlands, where parents
and tachers allow little kids to play "doctor" with one another in the spirit of positive bodily exploration.  It's
easier to be weird in a loose culture than in a tight one.
- pp. 52-53.

Essentially, cultures trade orderliness for creativity as they go from tighter to looser.
- p. 53.

Chapter 3 - The Exclusion, pp. 68-100.
People are, at their core, good, or at least decent.  Even the most ardent transphobe doesn't want to confront a
trans individual with their hatred face-to-face.  But, put those same people behind a keyboard, or send them to the
privacy of a voting booth, where the don't have to talk to or look at anyone different, where's just them and their
worst thoughts, "that's when the ugly comes out," she [Jess Herbst] said.
- p. 68.

The example of the Shiwiar shows why we humans, reflexively, like to take care of our own.  In our ancestral past, we
couldn't accumulate wealth or stockpile resources.  We were hunter-gatherers, and once we had hunted and gathered all
there was to hunt or gather in a given area, we had to move on.  Social relationships were the only bank deposit you
had.  To keep your group from going extinct, you had to provide your group members with resources when they were
struggling.
- p. 72.

Most researchers agree that the successful groups of our ancestral past were like the Shiwiar.  They were basically
like little hippie communes....
- p. 72.

Our distrust of outsiders might even explain the surprising rise of Donald Trump, who frequently targest minorities and
the "other" on Twitter and in his policies.
- p. 73.

Multiple studies and surveys have now shown that it was a fear of losing status to other groups -- like immigrants and
people of color -- that motivated many white Americans' support for Trump.
- p. 73.

Chapter 4 - The Sting, pp. 101-123.
Feeling uncertain about your identity for any reason -- either because of job loss, disconnection from your culture, or
even rapid technological change -- "can leav you with a thirst to identify with other people," as Michael Hogg put it to
me.  People in situations like these often want a leader who will tell them exactly what their group's purpose and identity
are.  Across several studies, researchers have found that when people feel like they're bobbing in a sea of uncertainty,
they will float toward the buoy that seems steadiest.  They will crave a leader who is ethnocentric and autocratic.  They
flock to cults, gangs, and other groups that will assign you a new identity and leave no room to question its nature.
- p. 116.

PART TWO: THE WEIRD ADVANTAGE
Chapter 5 - Creativity, pp. 127-142.
In fact, science suggests people actually *prefer* to belong to a group that is neither too inclusive nor too exclusive.
It can feel good to not fit in quite perfectly, or to be a little weird.
- p. 128.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Those who felt like they weren't part of any particular group were more creative when they were rejected by an arbitrary
collective.  There appears to be sommething about being a weirdo that uncorks your mind and allows new ideas to flow.
- p. 134.

The creative individuals, such as writers and actors, in his [Brown University psychiatrist Arnold Ludwig] sample were
more likely than, say businesspeople or soldiers to be "odd or peculiar" as children and to be considered "different" in
adulthood.
- p. 134.

In fact, people who don't fit neatly within any specific identity have been found, over and over again, to perform better
at innovative thinking.
- p. 136.

Bicultural people who view their cultural identities as blended, rather than in conflict with one another, are the ones who
tend to exhibit greater originality in their thinking -- at least when they're in situations that draw on both their cultures,
like a fusion restaurant or a cosmoplitan city.
- p. 136.

Solomon Asch's famous 1951 experiment revealed the occasional ludicrousness of conformity.  When told to compare a line with
three other lines....
[For details, google "Solomon Asch's famous 1951 experiment" or see https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html .]
Having just one person who broke with the majority reduced conformity among the participants by up to 80 percent.
- p. 141.

Chapter 6 - Truth, pp. 143-163.
By that point, Leslie was already beginning to see through him [Jonestown cult leader Jim Jones].  Jones, who insisted that
Temple members avoid nice clothing and jewelry, at one point informed his flock that he needed a Mercedes for protection.  It
struck Leslie as far-fetched that a man who cast himself as an all-powerful "Father" would need a luxury car to guard him.
- p. 150.

Sixteen months after she arrived in Jonestown, Leslie and nine others slipped past the guard shack and set out for Matthews
Ridge, a hetown [sic] nearly thirty miles away from Jonestown.  As Leslie walked through the jungle with Jakari strapped to
her back, her only fear was getting caught.  When the group arrived at a police station in Matthews Ricge, the police captain
told Leslie there were hundreds dead in Jonestown.  Later, Leslie would find out the casualties included her sister, brother,
mother, and Jakari's father, Joe.
- p. 153.

When we spoke, the son for whose sake she escaped, Jakari, was in prison for attempted murder.  This is, she acknowledges,
in part the result of a child hood spent in an unimaginably violent place.  The children of Jonestown were physically and
mentally tortured.  They were trained to say that they would do anything -- put their mother's hand in a garbage disposal,
cut off her breast -- for the cause.  They were groomed to be child soldiers, a second generation of miserable devotees.
- p. 154.

Though precise numbers are hard to come by, there appear to be hundreds of cultlike groups operating in North America.  It's
a need to belong, Leslie said, that explains their power.
- p. 154.

PART THREE: HOW TO BE DIFFERENT
Chapter 7 - Getting Support, pp. 167-175.
[none]
Chapter 8 - Comfort With Discomfort, pp. 176-184.
This strategy worked for no less than the Beatles, as the sociologist Ian Inglis described in the journal *Popular Music
and Society.  In the late 1950s, most of the top British performers had antiseptic images, and the nascent Beatles were
considered too wild.  Durin those infamous nights in Hamburg during which they racked up their ten thousand hours of
practice, the Beatles would taunt the crowd and call them Nazis.
- p. 178.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Chapter 9 - Better Than the Rest, pp. 183-215.
"I didn't find ignorance and prejudice would demotivate me," Michele explained.  "I found it would excite me."
- p. 187.

Chapter 10 - The Big Picture, pp. 191-215.
As Joan Didion put it, "We tell ourselves stories in order to live."  But the *kinds* of stories you tell yourself matter.
There are narratives about yourself in which your life can still get better, and there are those in which it will keep
getting worse.
- p. 210.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

One psychologist told me that a useful tactic for constructing these positive narratives could even be to lie to yourself
a little bit.  If you were bullied because you were frankly kind of a loser, just tell yourself it was because the other
kids were intimidated by how awesome you were.  That can give you the cognitive boost of a positive story, even if the
story was, in actuality, a little dispiriting.
- p. 211.

Chapter 10 - Change Yourself, pp. 216-230.
Many researchers have now found that adults can change the five traits that make up personality: extroversion, openness
to experience, emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.  Changing a trait primarily requires acting in
ways that embody [page break] that trait, just as Curt did, rather than simply thinking about it.
- pp. 219-220.

A personality change can occur across a variety of other domains and ages.
- p. 220.

George Kelly, a prominent 1950s psychologist, helped his clients chang by asking them to perform "roles" that represented
new personality traits.
- p. 220.

Geraldine Downey, a Columbia psychologist who studies social rejection, has found that socially excluded people who want
to become part of a group are better off if they assume that other people will like them.  They should behave *as if* they
are the popular kid.  Going into social interactions expecting the worse -- as I and many other weird kids often did -- tends
to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- p. 220.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

But friendship can be so difficult, and so time-consuming, that maybe this is just what the initial stage looks like: admitting
human connection is something you need, like vegetables and water, because it's good for you.  Eventually, you come to like it.
Or maybe even crave it.
- p. 225.
