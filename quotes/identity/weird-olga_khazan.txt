Notes and quotes from Weird, The Power of Being an Outsider in an Insider World, by Olga Khazan, 2020.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART ONE: BEING WEIRD
Chapter 1 - Weird, pp. 3-22.
A boy called me a "wetback" in the middle of class, and I thought seriously about changing my name.  When
we watcged the *Addams Family* movies, I developed a strong kinship with pale, dour, Wednesday Addams.
- p. 4. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

And *most* Americans report feeling lonely and misunderstood.  In a 2018 survey of 20,000 American adults,
54 percent of the respondents said that they "always or sometimes feel that no one knows them well," and
47 percent sometimes or always feel "left out."  "Most Americans," the report concluded, "are considered lonely."
- p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Either way, my weirdness was the defining experience of my life.  Both my pathologies and strengths flow from it.
- p. 19.

Here is the conclusion I cam to: It's good to be a weirdo.  Being different from other people around you confers
hidden advantages that can help you in life and in work.
- p. 20.

Chapter 2 - The Realization, pp. 23-67.
Because of this tendency for people to cluster with others like them, it is more difficult to find acceptance and
friendship in an environment where you're the different one.  No one, unfortunately, sees themselves in you.
- p. 42.

Tight cultures are those in which social norms [page break] are strict and formal, and the punishments for breaking
them are severe.  In tight cultures, people are more in step with one another, but loose cultures permit a wider range
of behaviors.  Tight cultures are the military, the Amish, or Singapore, where a nineteen-year-old American named
Michael Fay was caned in 1994 for vandalism.  Meanwhile, tech cultures are loose, as is the Netherlands, where parents
and tachers allow little kids to play "doctor" with one another in the spirit of positive bodily exploration.  It's
easier to be weird in a loose culture than in a tight one.
- pp. 52-53.

Essentially, cultures trade orderliness for creativity as they go from tighter to looser.
- p. 53.

Chapter 3 - The Exclusion, pp. 68-100.
People are, at their core, good, or at least decent.  Even the most ardent transphobe doesn't want to confront a
trans individual with their hatred face-to-face.  But, put those same people behind a keyboard, or send them to the
privacy of a voting booth, where the don't have to talk to or look at anyone different, where's just them and their
worst thoughts, "that's when the ugly comes out," she [Jess Herbst] said.
- p. 68.

The example of the Shiwiar shows why we humans, reflexively, like to take care of our own.  In our ancestral past, we
couldn't accumulate wealth or stockpile resources.  We were hunter-gatherers, and once we had hunted and gathered all
there was to hunt or gather in a given area, we had to move on.  Social relationships were the only bank deposit you
had.  To keep your group from going extinct, you had to provide your group members with resources when they were
struggling.
- p. 72.

Most researchers agree that the successful groups of our ancestral past were like the Shiwiar.  They were basically
like little hippie communes....
- p. 72.

Our distrust of outsiders might even explain the surprising rise of Donald Trump, who frequently targest minorities and
the "other" on Twitter and in his policies.
- p. 73.

Multiple studies and surveys have now shown that it was a fear of losing status to other groups -- like immigrants and
people of color -- that motivated many white Americans' support for Trump.
- p. 73.

Chapter 4 - The Sting, pp. 101-123.
Feeling uncertain about your identity for any reason -- either because of job loss, disconnection from your culture, or
even rapid technological change -- "can leav you with a thirst to identify with other people," as Michael Hogg put it to
me.  People in situations like these often want a leader who will tell them exactly what their group's purpose and identity
are.  Across several studies, researchers have found that when people feel like they're bobbing in a sea of uncertainty,
they will float toward the buoy that seems steadiest.  They will crave a leader who is ethnocentric and autocratic.  They
flock to cults, gangs, and other groups that will assign you a new identity and leave no room to question its nature.
- p. 116.

PART TWO: THE WEIRD ADVANTAGE
Chapter 5 - Creativity, pp. 127-142.
In fact, science suggests people actually *prefer* to belong to a group that is neither too inclusive nor too exclusive.
It can feel good to not fit in quite perfectly, or to be a little weird.
- p. 128.  [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Those who felt like they weren't part of any particular group were more creative when they were rejected by an arbitrary
collective.  There appears to be sommething about being a weirdo that uncorks your mind and allows new ideas to flow.
- p. 134.
The creative individuals, such as writers and actors, in his [Brown University psychiatrist Arnold Ludwig] sample were
more likely than, say businesspeople or soldiers to be "odd or peculiar" as children and to be considered "different" in
adulthood.
