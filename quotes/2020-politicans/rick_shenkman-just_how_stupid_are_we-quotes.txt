Quotes from Just How Stupid Are We?  Facing the Truth About the American Voter,
by Rick Shenkman, 2008.

Five defining characteristics of stupidity, it seems to me, are readily apparent.
First is sheer ignorance....
Second is negligence....
Third is wooden-headedness....
Fourth is shortsightedness....
Fifth, and finally, is a broad category I call bone-headedness, for want of a better
word: the susceptibility to meaningless phrases, stereotypes, irrational [page break]
biases, and simplistic diagnoses and solutions that play on our hopes and fears.
 - pp. 14-15.

Asked in one national poll whether they supported a constitutional amendment allowing
only marriage between a man and a woman, a majority said yes.  But three questions
later a majority also agreed that 'defining marriage was not an important enough issue
to be worth changing the Constitution.'  The New York Times wryly summed up the
results: Americans clearly favor amending the Constitution but not changing it.

[Chapter 4, the Importance of Myths, spans pages 53 through 66.]
But there is no denying that after the masses got the vote in the 1830s (when property
qualifications were abolished), myths became the driving force in our politics.
 - p. 54.

Most other American pols have not had nearly as good a story to tell [as FDR's].  FDR's
cousin Teddy had to make do with the tale of his triumph over childhood asthma and his
ride up San Juan Hill (actually, Kettle Hill).  John Kennedy had to inflate the story of
the sinking of his [page break] PT 109 boat in World War II.  George Herber Walker Bush
was reduced to bragging that he ate pork rinds.  His son has made himself sound like a
cornpone hick.  John Kerry, married to one of the wealthiest women in America by virtue
of her previous marriage to a member of the Heinz ketchup family, had himself photographed
standing in front of a bale of hay (his wife's mansion was deliberately kept out of view).
Howard Dean, who was raised in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, gave a speech in Iowa in
which he referred to himself and his audience of farmers as 'us rural people.'
 - pp. 60-61.

Was he [George W. Bush] really dumb, or did he just pretend to be?  Whole books have been
produced to demonstrate that he **is** dumb.
 - p. 62.

It is truly remarkable that a man [George W. Bush] with his distinguished educational
pedigree - Andover, Yale, and Harvard - and his membership in one of the country's
greatest political dynasties came to be regarded as a man of the people.
 - p. 62.

Neither Jimmy Carter's enticing smile nor George W. Bush's down-home style, which seemed
attractive on television, gave the voter solid clues as to their performance as president.
In this way television misleads people.  It gives them confidence that, because they
can see the candidates, they 'know' who they really are.  This is nonsense.
 - p. 106.

Against the great force of television what chance does the viewer have to reach a calm,
dispassionate, rational view of things? ....  But of course, the ordinary viewer does
none of these things.  Instead, he watches the spots, thinks about them for a brief
moment or two, then quietly absorbs whatever warped information they happen to convey.
Then, if he's one of the conscientious citizens of the Republic, he casts a ballot.
Study after study shows that the spots are one of the voters' chief sources of
information - and often the only source.
 - p. 108.

[O]ne of their [the Founding Fathers'] motivations in replacing the weak Articles of
Confederaton with the Constitution was that they wished to curb the power of state
governments, several of which had come to be dominated by powerful demagogues: Patrick
Henry in Virginia, John Hancock in Massachusettes, and Samuel Chase in Maryland.  No
republic in history had survived for long.  And here, just a few short years after the
Revolution, was evidence that, in our own, The People were becoming attached to rulers
who played on their emotions.
A great fear expressed by the founders was that ordinary people would use their power
at the ballot box to [page break] confiscate the wealth of the many and give it to the
few, as was already happening in several states, where creditors were on the defensive.
 - pp. 147-148.

The timing of this development could not be stranger.  Here we are in the Second Gilded
Age, when every single person on the Forbes 400 list is a billionaire, and CEOs often
earn several times more money in a day than their employees do in a year, and the
conservatves who are the defenders of wealth and privilege are claiming to be one with
The People while liberals are derided as elitists.  As the saying goes, **Only in
America!**
What sustains the conservative faith in The People is, above all, the resistance of
millions of ordinary voters to the social changes that have taken place in modern
American life involving abortion, homosexuality, and feminism.  So long as these
voters persist in their resistance, conservatism will remain a powerful force.  If
fresh challenges to the social order are made, conservatism undoubtedly will enjoy
a rebirth.
 - p. 166.

In **Language in Action,** he [S. I. Hiyakawa, a semanticist] explores the appeal of
propaganda, asking why and how it works.  he argues that demagogues succeed in persuading
people to support one thing or another through the use of meaningless abstractions, words
like **freedom** and **liberty.**  To guard themselves against the emotional power of
such words, citizens need to be taught th demand language that is concrete.  if an
abstract word is used in a speech with no meaningful referent, the listener should
disregard it.  If the word **freedom** is not defined precisely, it should be ignored.
 - p. 175.
A second of his observations deals with ... what he calls the "two-valued orientation."
By this he means the false division of the world into two categories, good and evil.
Anything that stands in the way of the demagogue's goals is considered evil, anything
that furthers his goals is considered good.  There is no middle ground.  The consequence
of this Manichean appropaoch to politics is that the resort to violence is more likely.
To compromise is to give in to the demands of the devil.
 - p. 175.
