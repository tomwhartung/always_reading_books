"There, on that stair landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word *cornered.*  There were hordes of rats in the front entryway.  My friends and I used to chase them around with sticks.  Once I spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until I drove it into a corner.  It had nowhere to run.  Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me.  I was surprised and frightened.  Now the rat was chasing me.  It jumped across the landing and down the stairs.  Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door shut in its nose."
-- Russian President Vladimir Putin, from First Person, An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait, 2000.

In an interview with Vladimir's school teacher, Vera Dmitrievna Gurevich, she describes the home where he grew up. "There was no hot water, no bathtub," she says.
"There was practically no kitchen. It was just a square, dark hallway without windows.. A gas burner stood on one side and a sink on the other. There was no room to move around.
"The apartment was communal. And the Putins were squeezed into one room. By the standards of those days it was decent, though, because it measured about 20 meters square."
