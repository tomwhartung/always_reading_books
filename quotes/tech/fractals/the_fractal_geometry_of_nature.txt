Notes and quotes from The Fractal Geometry of Nature by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, 1982
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1: Introduction
Chapter 1: Theme
More generally, I claim that many patterns of Nature are so irregular and fragmented, that, compared with
*Euclid* -- a term used in this work to denote all of standard geometry -- Nature exhibits not simply a
higher degree but an altogether different level of complexity.
 - p. 1. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Responding to this challenge, I conceived and developed a new geometry of nature and implemented its use in
a number of diverse fields.  It describes many of the irregular and fragmented patterns around us, and leads
to full-fledged theories, by identifying a family of shapes I call *fracals.*  The most useful fractals involve
*chance* and both their regularities and their irregularities are statistical.  Also, implying that the degree
of their irregularity and/or fragmentation is identical at all scales.  The concept of *fractal (Hausdorff)
*dimension* plays a central role in this work.

PRESENTATION OF GOALS
This Essay brings together a number of analyses in diverse sciences, and it promotes a new mathematical and
philosophical synthesis.  Thus, it serves as both a *casebook* and a *manifesto.*  Furthermore, it reveals a
totally new world of plastic beauty.

A MANIFESTO: THERE IS A FRACTAL FACE TO THE GEOMETRY OF NATURE
F. J. Dyson has given an eloquent summary of this theme of mine.
 - p. 3.

[Quoting F. J. Dyson:]
"These new structures were regarded ... as 'pathological," ... as a 'gallery of monsters,' kin to the cubist painting
and atonal music that were upsetting standards of taste in the arts at about the same time."
 - p. 3. [Elipses are as they appear in the quoted text in the book.]

Chapter 3: Dimension, Symmetry, Divergence
[D{sub T} is the Topological dimension.]
The more intuitive of the two is the the topological dimension according to Brouwer, Lebesgue, Menger, and Urysohn.  We
denote it by D{sub T}.  It is described in an entry in Chapter 41.  The second dimension was formulated by in Hausdorff
1919 and put in final form by Besicovitch.  It is discussed in Chapter 39.  We denote it by D.
 - p. 15.

The dimension D{sub T} us *always an integer,* but D *need not be an integer.*  And the two dimensions need not coincide;
they only satisfy the Szpilrajn inequality (Hurewicz & Wallman 1941, Chapter 4).
 - p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

*A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the Topological dimension.*
 - p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

But D may be an integer (not greater than E but strictly greater than D{sub T}).  I call D a *fractal dimension.*
 - p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

[Ball = point, thread = line, veil = plane.]
However, physicists prefer to think of a veil, a thread, or a ball -- if they are fine enough -- as being "in effect" of
dimensions 2, 1, and 0, respectively.
 - p. 17.

In other words, effective dimension inevitably has a subjective basis.  It is a matter of approximation and therefore of
degree of resolution.
 - p. 17.
