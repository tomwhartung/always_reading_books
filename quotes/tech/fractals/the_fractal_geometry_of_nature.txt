Notes and quotes from The Fractal Geometry of Nature by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, 1982
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1: Introduction
Chapter 1: Theme
More generally, I claim that many patterns of Nature are so irregular and fragmented, that, compared with
*Euclid* -- a term used in this work to denote all of standard geometry -- Nature exhibits not simply a
higher degree but an altogether different level of complexity.
 - p. 1. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Responding to this challenge, I conceived and developed a new geometry of nature and implemented its use in
a number of diverse fields.  It describes many of the irregular and fragmented patterns around us, and leads
to full-fledged theories, by identifying a family of shapes I call *fracals.*  The most useful fractals involve
*chance* and both their regularities and their irregularities are statistical.  Also, implying that the degree
of their irregularity and/or fragmentation is identical at all scales.  The concept of *fractal (Hausdorff)
*dimension* plays a central role in this work.
 - p. 1. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

PRESENTATION OF GOALS
This Essay brings together a number of analyses in diverse sciences, and it promotes a new mathematical and
philosophical synthesis.  Thus, it serves as both a *casebook* and a *manifesto.*  Furthermore, it reveals a
totally new world of plastic beauty.

A MANIFESTO: THERE IS A FRACTAL FACE TO THE GEOMETRY OF NATURE
F. J. Dyson has given an eloquent summary of this theme of mine.
 - p. 3.

[Quoting F. J. Dyson:]
"These new structures were regarded ... as 'pathological," ... as a 'gallery of monsters,' kin to the cubist painting
and atonal music that were upsetting standards of taste in the arts at about the same time."
 - p. 3. [Elipses are as they appear in the quoted text in the book.]

Chapter 3: Dimension, Symmetry, Divergence
[D{sub T} is the Topological dimension.]
The more intuitive of the two is the the topological dimension according to Brouwer, Lebesgue, Menger, and Urysohn.  We
denote it by D{sub T}.  It is described in an entry in Chapter 41.  The second dimension was formulated by in Hausdorff
1919 and put in final form by Besicovitch.  It is discussed in Chapter 39.  We denote it by D.
 - p. 15.

The dimension D{sub T} us *always an integer,* but D *need not be an integer.*  And the two dimensions need not coincide;
they only satisfy the Szpilrajn inequality (Hurewicz & Wallman 1941, Chapter 4).
 - p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

*A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the Topological dimension.*
 - p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

But D may be an integer (not greater than E but strictly greater than D{sub T}).  I call D a *fractal dimension.*
 - p. 15. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

[Ball = point, thread = line, veil = plane.]
However, physicists prefer to think of a veil, a thread, or a ball -- if they are fine enough -- as being "in effect" of
dimensions 2, 1, and 0, respectively.
 - p. 17.

In other words, effective dimension inevitably has a subjective basis.  It is a matter of approximation and therefore of
degree of resolution.
 - p. 17.

Chapter 4: Variations and Disclaimers
It is widely held that minimal art is restricted to limited combinations of standard shapes: lines, circles, spirals, and
the like.  But such need not be the case.  The fractals in scientific models are also very simple (because science puts a
premium on simplicity).  And I agree that many ma be viewed as a new form of minimal geometric art.
Is some of it reminiscent of M. C. Escher?  It should be, because Escher had the merit of letting himself be inspired by the
hyperbolic tilings in Fricke & Klein 1897, which (see Chapter 18) relate closely to shapes that are being incorporated into
the fractal realm.
 - p. 23.

Chapter 6: Snowflakes and other Koch Curves
These voices had not been heard, however.  Not only near every book but every science museum proclaims that nondifferentiable
equations are counter-intuitive, "monstrous," "pathological," or even "psychopathic."
 - p. 36.

Chapter 7: Harnessing the Peano Monster Curves
The corresponding limits, exemplified in upcoming plates, are called *Peano curves,* because the first is found in Peano 1890.
They are also called *plane-filling curves.*
 - p. 58. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

As a matter of fact if a tree made of rivers of vanishing width is to drain an area thoroughly, it *must* penetrate everywhere.
One who follows the rivers' combined bank performs a plane-filling motion.  Ask any child for confirmation!
 - p. 59. [Emphasis in original as italics.]

Chapter 8: Fractal Events and Cantor Dusts
In Cantor 1883, the initiator is the closed interval [0,1].  The term "closed" and the use of brackets indicate that the extreme
points are included....  The first construction stage consists in dividing the [0,1] into 3 pieces, then removing the middle open
third, designated by ]1/3,2/3[.  The term "open" and the use of reversed brackets indicate that the extreme points are excluded.
Next one removes the open middle of each of N=2 remaining thirds.  And so on to infinity.
 - p. 76.

Chapter 13: Islands, Clusters, and Percolation: Diameter-Number Relations
p. 125 shows how to use a 3x3 grid to make fractal designs.
Idea: use a 5x5 grid to represent the big 5 factors?

Chapter 14: Ramification and Fractal Lattices
Long ago and far away, the Great Ruler and his retinue had sat their power in the spendid Snowflake Halls.  A schism occurs, a war
follows, ending in stalemate, and finally Wise Elders draw a line to divide the Halls between the contenders from the North and the
South.

Chapter 18: Self-Inverse Fractals, Apollonian Nets, and Soap
The bulk of this Essay is devoted to fractals that are either fully invariant under similitudes or, at least, "nearly" self-similar.
As a result, the reader may have formed the impression that the notion of fractal is wedded to self-similarity.  Such is emphatically
*not* the case, but fractal geometry must begin by dealing with the fractal counterpoints to straight lines ... call them "linear
fractals."
 - p. 166 [Emphasis in original as italics, and elipses are as they appear in the book.]
